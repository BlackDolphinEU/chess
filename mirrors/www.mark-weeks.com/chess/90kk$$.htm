<P>
The fifth title match between Kasparov and Karpov saw the 24 game match split
between 12 games in New York City and 12 in Lyon.

There would be fewer games in New York if one player gained a
commanding lead.

<P>
At the time of the match, Kasparov was 27 years old and rated 2800. Karpov was
39 years old and rated 2730.

<P>
The prize fund was 3.000.000 US$, with 5/8 to winner.

If the match ended in a tie, Kasparov would retain the title with the prize
shared equally.

<P>
The time control was 40 moves in 2 1/2 hours, followed by an
adjournment, then 16 moves in 1 hour.

Each player had three timeouts.

<P>
Kasparov's team consisted of
Zurab Azmaiparashvili and Sergey Dolmatov, who were also at
<A HREF="87kk$$.htm">Seville in 1987</A>;
Mikhail Gurevich, who was at
<A HREF="86kk$$.htm">Leningrad in 1986</A>;
Giya Georgadze, who was new for the match; and
Alexander Shakarov, a long time friend.

Klara Kasparova served as the head of his delegation.

Missing from the team was a chief trainer, which had formerly been
Alexander Nikitin.

Andrew Page was Kasparov's business manager.

<P>
Karpov's team was
Ron Henley,
Lajos Portisch,
Andrei Kharitonov,
Alexei Kuzmin,
Mikhail Podgaets, and
Igor Zaitsev.

Nikolai Krogius, a psychologist by training, served as the head of his
delegation.

<P>
The match arbiter was Geurt Gijssen.

Frenchman Dan-Antoine Blanc-Shapira served as master of ceremonies.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">
Games 1-12; New York
</FONT></H3>

<P>
The New York portion of the match, sponsored by Interscope, was played
in the 750 seat Hudson Theater at the Hotel Macklowe.

Moves were relayed on a 15 foot electronic demo board, with cordless
headphones to provide commentary.

Match commentators were
Yasser Seirawan,
Patrick Wolff, and
Bruce Pandolfini.

<P>
In January, Kasparov had been forced to leave his native Baku, where he had
trained for his previous matches.

He confessed later that his preparation had been below that of his
previous matches and recognized that Karpov was better prepared than
ever.

<P>
Most observers expected the match to be close, with Kasparov winning.

GM Joel Lautier of France was one of the few who gave Karpov the better
chances.

<P>
The opening ceremony was held on 7 October, followed by a gala ball in
the evening at Hotel Waldorf Astoria.

600 people were invited including David Dinkins, mayor of New York,
who declined to attend, although Michel Noir, mayor of Lyon, attended.

<P>
Kasparov won the right to choose the colors for the first game and
picked Black, to his obvious disappointment.

Karpov surprised everyone by suggesting that in the event of a drawn
match, the players should continue until the first decisive game.

<P>
Both players should have displayed the flag of the Soviet Union, but
Kasparov chose to use the new tricolor Russian flag to show support
for Boris Yeltsin.

Karpov protested on the grounds that FIDE rules dictated that
"miniature flags of the nations to which the players belong are to be
placed on the table".

Appeals jury Lim Kok An and Bessel Kok decided that there would be no
flags.

<P>
The first game was played on 8 October.

After the first game, the match was largely ignored by the major
U.S. television networks.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 1 - King's Indian Defense</B></CENTER>

<P>
The first game became a Saemisch Variation (5.f3), an opening which
had not been seen in previous matches.

Kasparov equalized easily and the game was drawn after 30 moves.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 2 - Ruy Lopez</B></CENTER>

<P>
The Zaitsev Variation was last seen in game 16 of the 1986 match.

On the 25th move, Kasparov sacrificed a bishop.

further.

The game was an impressive victory for Kasparov, who now led 1.5-0.5.

<P>
Karpov used a timeout after game 2.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 3 - King's Indian Defense</B></CENTER>

for rook and knight.

The game was adjourned, but Kasparov resigned before resumption.

Kasparov said later that this was the worst blunder of his career.

The match was equal at 3 1/2 points each.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 8 - Ruy Lopez</B></CENTER>

<P>
The opening followed the sixth game, with Kasparov varying on move 12.

two disconnected passed pawns on the queenside.

Kasparov managed to hold the position when the game was resumed and it was
drawn on the 84th move.

<P>
Although having battled for two days, neither player wanted to use a
timeout and the ninth game was played the next day.

Both players seemed extremely tired.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 9 - Gruenfeld Defense</B></CENTER>

<P>
The opening followed game 11 of the 1987 match until Karpov varied on his
7th move, avoiding the Seville variation.

Karpov had the better position, but blundered on the 32nd move by losing a

Avoiding any risk, Kasparov returned the pawn a few moves later and the game
was agreed drawn.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 10 - Petrov Defense</B></CENTER>

<P>
Kasparov avoided variations played in several previous matches by playing
3.d4.

The game was an 18 move draw which angered the spectators, some of
whom had paid 100 US$ for the best seats.

Since each game was worth 125.000 US$, the spectators expected more
from the players.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 11 - King's Indian Defense</B></CENTER>

<P>
The opening followed game 5 until Kasparov varied with 7...exd4.

Kasparov sacrificed the exchange on his 13th move.

<P>
Boris Spassky, during a press conference before his
<A HREF="92fs$$.htm">1992 match</A>
with Fischer, was asked if he agreed with Fischer's opinion that the
Kasparov-Karpov matches had been prearranged. He answered

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<SMALL>
That's a very serious question, thank you. I can only speak about my
personal experience during the last match at Lyon. In particular, the
19th game. In that game, the draw was agreed on the 38th move, and
Kasparov had 15 minutes for his last moves in a winning position. I
became suspicious, I got angry, and I swept the pieces from the board.

<P>
[...]

<P>
I was commenting on the match for the public and just before the
players agreed to the draw, I was saying, "OK, it's simple. Kasparov
is probably going to win this game." I was therefore very shocked at
what happened.

<P>
After the game Kasparov tried to explain what had happened. His
explanation was not sufficient for me.

</SMALL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Spassky has a reputation of being a gentleman, so his suspicions
should cause some concern. Why would the two players want to
prearrange the result of a game? One can only speculate.

Kasparov later excused the draw "on account of enormous fatigue".

<P><CENTER><B>Game 20 - Ruy Lopez</B></CENTER>

<P>
Karpov returned to the Zaitsev variation, last seen in game 4.

Kasparov varied with 18.Rae3, sacrificed a pawn, then sacrificed a bishop,
and with all of his pieces trained on Karpov's king, won the game with a
spectacular attack.

<P>
Kasparov now led 11-9 and needed only one point in the last four games to
retain the title.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 21 - King's Indian Defense</B></CENTER>

<P>
Karpov returned to the Saemisch which had not been seen since the first
game of the match.

Kasparov varied with 6...e5.

Karpov inexplicably played 17.Bd3-c2 followed by 18.Bd3, giving up two
tempi.

<P>
Kasparov played the middle game imprecisely, sacrificed a pawn to open up a
line on White's king, and the game was adjourned with Karpov having an
advantage.

In his book on the match, Kasparov wrote, "The adjourned position was
extremely difficult for me. Even now I do not know its correct
evaluation. As Dolmatov said, this ending demonstrated human
helplessness in the face of chess."

When the game resumed, Karpov sacrificed an exchange to create a dangerous
passed pawn.

Kasparov played a counter sacrifice and both players queened a pawn.

<P>
Karpov was unable to find shelter for his king and the game ended in a
draw after 86 moves.

After game 21, Kasparov led 11.5-9.5 and needed one more draw in the three
remaining games to keep the title.

<P>
Karpov used his third timeout for the 22nd game, Saturday, 22
December.

The organizers were not happy, because this was the day when they
expected to sell the most tickets.

There was no game on Monday, 24 December, because of Christmas Eve
when a 'technical timeout' was granted by Campomanes.

The match resumed on 26 December.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 22 - Ruy Lopez</B></CENTER>

<P>
The players repeated the opening from game 4 until Karpov varied with
18...Bxd5.

Karpov sacrificed two pawns to create a dangerous passed pawn, but Kasparov
countersacrificed a knight for a pawn to stop the counterplay.

Near the end of the first session, Kasparov forced a perpetual check and was
assured of keeping the title for another three years.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 23 - King's Indian Defense</B></CENTER>

<P>
The opening followed game 21 until Kasparov varied with 8...Qh4+.

<P>
Karpov needed to win the last game to split the prize money.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 24 - English Opening</B></CENTER>

<P>
For the first time in the match, Kasparov did not play 1.e4.

He won a pawn and, in a winning position, offered a draw.

He admitted afterwards that he had only been playing for a draw.

The difference between a draw and a loss in this game was worth
375.000 US$ plus the Korlov jewel.

<P>
Black did not win a single game in the match.

Karpov played only 1.d4, which Kasparov answered exclusively with the
King's Indian and Gruenfeld Defense.

Kasparov played only 1.e4, except for the last game.

<P>
The players held a press conference on 2 January 1991.

Kasparov said after the match that the organization had been more
professional at New York than at Lyon.

There was too much attention in Lyon to the 'spectacle' and not enough
to the chess.

<P>
Most observers expected that the 1993 match would be between the same
players.
