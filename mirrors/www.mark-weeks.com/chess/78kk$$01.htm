<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The moves of a chess game are completely divorced from the physical
context in which they were played.

We can play the moves, we can analyze them, we can admire their beauty
without having any idea of the circumstances surrounding them.

<P>
The events surrounding the 1978 match were among the most bizarre that
a world championship match has ever seen.

Here we try to recall those events as historic in their own right.

We must not forget that all of this was a backdrop for a chess match.

The games of this match are described on a <A
HREF="78kk$$.htm">separate page</A>.

<P>
We are fortunate that many accounts, sometimes conflicting, have been
written by the match principals --

<A HREF="wcc-blio.htm#kar-fbtm">Karpov & Baturinsky</A>,
<A HREF="wcc-blio.htm#edm-chsc">Edmondson</A>,
<A HREF="wcc-blio.htm#kee-kkmm">Keene</A>, and
Korchnoi

-- as well as by close observers of the international chess scene like
Larsen and Hartston.

The events described here are taken from these sources.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">Flags</FONT></H3>

<P>
After defecting from the Soviet Union, Korchnoi was a man without a
country.

During the 1977 candidates semifinal match against Polugaevsky, he
asked to play under the Dutch flag.

He was living in the Netherlands and had recently won the national
championship.

Baturinsky, the head of Polugaevsky's delegation, objected on the
grounds that Korchnoi had not been living in the Netherlands for a
full year.

Keene and Stean suggested that Korchnoi play under the Jolly Roger.

<P>
In September of the same year, Korchnoi was granted permission to live
in Switzerland.

Bondarevsky, the head of Spassky's delegation during the candidates
final match, insisted that Korchnoi not be allowed to play under the
Swiss flag.

Spassky played under the Soviet flag, while Korchnoi had no flag.

<P>
A month before the title match, Korchnoi indicated that if he could
not play under the Swiss flag, he wanted a white flag marked
'Stateless'.

FIDE sought legal opinion on whether Korchnoi was entitled to use the
Swiss flag, and was advised that this would not violate any law.

The Soviets objected to the Swiss flag, but agreed to a white flag
marked 'Stateless'.

The jury decided that no flags would be allowed on the playing table,
but that flags of the USSR, the Philippines, and FIDE would be present
on the stage.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">Sunglasses</FONT></H3>

<P>
Korchnoi wore mirror sunglasses for the first game and continued to
wear them during some of the following games.

During the 1974 match he had been bothered by Karpov's habit of
staring at his opponent, so in Baguio he wore the glasses to hide his
eyes.

<A HREF="wcc-blio.htm#kar-fbtm">Karpov wrote</A>, '[The sunglasses]
were like two mirrors, and whenever Korchnoi raised his head the light
from the numerous lamps on the stage was reflected into my eyes', and
complained to Schmid about the glasses.

<P>
Before game 9, the arbiters tried wearing sunglasses and taking
positions at the board as though they were playing a game.

They pronounced the glasses 'not disturbing'.

Karpov felt that he was not being taken seriously by Schmid and
questioned his objectivity.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">Chairs</FONT></H3>

<P>
Chairs also contributed to the match tension.

In prematch discussions Korchnoi declared his intention to bring his
own chair, a dark green Stollgiroflex, and stipulated that the chairs
'may not turn but may move only to the front and back'

Karpov's chair was furnished by the organizers. 

He needed a small cushion to raise him to Korchnoi's level.

<P>
Karpov requested that Korchnoi's chair be examined for 'extraneous
objects or prohibited devices'.

A few days before the first game, the chair was dismantled, X-rayed at
Baguio General Hospital, and cleared.

<P>
During game 14 Korchnoi complained to Schmid that Karpov was swiveling
in his chair.

Karpov swiveled again during game 15 and Korchnoi complained. 

Schmid talked to Karpov about it, but Karpov continued -- 'I'll stop
swiveling if he takes off his glasses'.

The jury decided the next day that 'swiveling of one's chair or
standing behind it are not to be allowed'.

Karpov stopped swiveling during Korchnoi's move for game 16.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">Yogurt</FONT></H3>

<P>
On the 25th move of game 2, a waiter delivered a tray with a glass of
violet colored yogurt to Karpov.

After the game Leeuwerik sent a letter to Schmid protesting the
yogurt.
 
'It is clear that a cunningly arranged distribution of edible items to
one player during the game, emanating from one delegation or the
other, could convey a kind of code message'.

Although the letter was almost certainly tongue-in-cheek, Baturinsky
took it seriously and suggested that the binoculars Leeuwerik used
during the game might also convey a coded message to Korchnoi.

<P>
By the time a waiter delivered another tray holding yogurt to Karpov
on the 17th move of game 3, the first incident had been blown out of
proportion by both Baturinsky and Leeuwerik.

A few days later the jury met and agreed that Karpov could receive a
beverage at a fixed time and that Schmid would be notified before the
game if it would not be a violet colored yogurt.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">Zukhar</FONT></H3>

<P>
Who was Vladimir P. Zukhar? Edmondson described him as a
'Psychological Consultant. A psycho-neurologist and director of the
Central Laboratory for Psychology in Moscow's School of Medecine'.

<P>
<A HREF="wcc-blio.htm#kar-fbtm">Karpov wrote</A> in his book about the match:-
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So why in fact did I need -- and I certainly did need -- Dr. Zukhar? 

<P>
Let us go back a few years... The Final Candidates Match for the World
Championship has just begun. Each time when I turn to face the nearest
box in the theater, I involuntarily notice among Korchnoi's trainers a
man who tries to catch my eye. I ask who this man is, and it
transpires that he works with Korchnoi. The thought did not occur to
me that hypnotism was being used against me, and I did not demand that
this person should sit further away, but I decided to engage my own
psychologist. And that is how I came to make the acquaintance of
Vladimir Zukhar... (p.29)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Later in the same book
<A HREF="wcc-blio.htm#kar-fbtm">Baturinsky wrote</A>:-
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Among the persons accompanying Karpov to the 1978 match was Dr. V.P.
Zukhar, a professor of psychology, who over a period of several years
had acted as consultant to the World Champion, observing his work,
sleep, rest and mood, and giving necessary advice. This was also
Zukhar's function during the match, and there was nothing unusual
about this, since in modern day sport the role of psychology is
generally recognized... (p.79)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Zukhar was admitted to the Philippines as a member of Karpov's
delegation. 

After game 1, when the first three rows of the spectator area reserved
for Marcos and other VIPs were empty, the spectators started to move
forward.

Zukhar and some other Soviets seated themselves in the second row.

<A HREF="wcc-blio.htm#edm-chsc">Edmondson wrote</A> of game 4:-
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Korchnoi headed immediately for his easy chair after making [his 14th
move], obviously expecting that Karpov would consider his reply at
length. And Karpov did just that; he thought for 39 minutes, during
most of which the challenger relaxed and enjoyed his tea and
chocolate.

[...]

In the second row left were ensconced Valery Krylov, Karpov's physical
trainer, and a Dr. Zukhar -- the second doctor (exact duties
unspecified) in Karpov's entourage. Dr. Zukhar fixed an unbroken stare
upon Korchnoi during the entire 39 minutes which Karpov devoted to
[his 15th] move; Korchnoi seemed not to notice. (p.31)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> 
Zukhar took the same seat in the first session of game 5.

When he moved to the first row for the second session, Leeuwerik's
daughter sat on his right  and stared directly at him.

Her boyfriend took the seat to Zukhar's left.

<P> 
Game 6 was played between the second and third sessions of game 5.

Before the game Leeuwerik complained to Campomanes that Zukhar was a
parapsychologist assigned to 'confuse Korchnoi's thinking', thereby
increasing his problems in time trouble.

When Leeuwerik asked Campomanes to ensure that no one sat in the front
row, Campomanes forwarded the request to Baturinsky, who agreed.

Zukhar sat in the second row.

During the third session of game 5, he sat in the third row,
sandwiched by his own delegation, and stared at Korchnoi.

Leeuwerik sat directly behind him.

<P>
At the start of game 7, Zukhar was again in the second row.

A few minutes into the game Korchnoi complained to Schmid, suggesting
that the game should be played elsewhere.

Although he finally agreed to play in the main hall, he disappeared
from view each time Karpov was on move.

Zukhar in turn was harassed by Korchnoi's people, most notably when
Leeuwerik offered him a copy of Solzhenitsyn's <I>The Gulag
Archipelago</I>.

After the game Schmid spoke with Campomanes -- something had to be
done about Zukhar.

<P>
Before the second session of game 7, Campomanes issued a memo which
attempted to place all 'accredited persons' in the last three rows.

Baturinsky objected on the grounds that the second session was still
to be played, and Campomanes agreed to start with game 8.

Later that day Karpov addressed a letter to the jury, where he
objected to Campomanes memo on the grounds that it changed prematch
agreements.

Keene sent a letter to Campomanes complaining about Zukhar.

<P>
On the morning when game 8 was to be played, the jury met and agreed
that Korchnoi had been disturbed by Zukhar. 

If it happened again, Schmid would have the authority either to eject
the spectator from the playing area or to move the game to another
room.

Zukhar sat in the fifth row for game 8 and there were no problems.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">Handshakes & draw offers</FONT></H3>

<P>
As game 8 was about to start, Korchnoi was left with his hand in
midair when Karpov refused to shake with him -- 'Never! Never will I
shake hands with you!"

Roshal explained during the next press conference, 'Recent events have
shown that the Challenger has not reduced his line of intensifying
tensions and under such circumstances Karpov does not wish to shake
hands with Korchnoi.'

<P>
Schmid sent a letter to Baturinsky, pointing out that the Chief Arbiter
should have been informed in advance about Karpov's decision.

Keene commented, 'It will save Viktor having to go into his dressing
room to wash his hands after the start of each game.'

<P>
A week later, Keene sent a letter to Schmid apologizing for the washing
remark.

He also sent cigars, with his own name printed on the wrapper, to
Baturinsky.

A day later Baturinsky sent a bar of soap, with 'Viktor Baturinsky'
written on the wrapper, to Keene.

<P>
In response to Karpov's refusal to shake hands, Korchnoi started
insisting that the players should not speak to each other.

Draws could only be offered through the arbiter.

Karpov refused to go along with this, considering the complications
this could bring in time scrambles.

His point was proven during the match.

<P>
As the players were about to adjourn game 12, Karpov offered a draw
directly to Korchnoi.

Korchnoi indicated with a nod that he should go through Schmid, but
Karpov shrugged his shoulders and left the playing area.

After sealing his move, Korchnoi gave the envelope to Schmid and
complained about Karpov's direct offer of a draw.

Schmid misunderstood and thought that Korchnoi was offering a draw.

He relayed the offer to Karpov, who accepted it the next day.

When Schmid announced to Korchnoi that his draw offer had been
accepted, Korchnoi was very surprised, but agreed with the result to
avoid embarrassing Schmid.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">Zukhar (cont.)</FONT></H3>

<P>
Before game 9 Korchnoi asked to use the alternate playing room.

Zukhar was sitting in row 5, but moved to row 7, and the game
continued in public.

<P>
Baturinsky held an impromptu press conference to reveal the content of
a letter to Campomanes.

His point was that Zukhar performed an important function and a right
to watch Karpov's play closely.

He also denied that Zukhar was an official member of Karpov's
delegation.

<P>
Immediately afterwards, Leeuwerik held a press conference.

'We do not ask that Zukhar be ejected from the hall, only that he sit
at the rear. If this is not done, then the game must be moved to the
alternate playing room'.

<P>
During the game, Schmid asked Korchnoi if he still wanted the game
moved to the alternate room.

Korchnoi declined the offer, 'At this moment, I am not disturbed. I
want to play'.

When Leeuwerik learned that Korchnoi was 'not disturbed' by Zukhar,
she replied, 'Korchnoi must really be going mad. Now he doesn't even
know that he is being disturbed'.

<P>
After game 9 Karpov sent a letter to the jury, complaining about
Schmid's request to move Zukhar.

Korchnoi sent his own letter to the jury, complaining about Zukhar.

The jury met and voted to agree with Karpov -- it disagreed with
Korchnoi, because during the 9th game he had said that he was not
being disturbed.

Leeuwerik responded, 'We have seen that the jury is not neutral and
will decide against us, whether we are right or not. This is because
four of its members -- Baturinsky, Malchev, Lim, and Campomanes -- are
pro-Soviet.'

Her remark was particularly insulting to Lim and Campomanes.

<P>
She also announced that Korchnoi was bringing in his own
'parapsychologist, neurologist, and hypnotist', Dr. Vladimir Berginer.

Berginer had been born in the USSR, had emigrated to Israel, and was a
neurologist at Ben Gurion University Hospital in Beersheba.

He stayed in the same hotel as the rest of Korchnoi's team.

<P>
During game 10, Filip served as Chief Arbiter.

Zukhar, surrounded by groups of young Philippine women, sat in the
seventh row and stared at Korchnoi.

Leeuwerik gave another press conference to attack the jury, while
Campomanes and Lim gave separate press conferences to defend their
neutrality.

Lim said, 'Mr. Korchnoi should realize that because I am not
anti-Soviet, it does not mean that I am pro-Soviet'.

<P> 
Schmid was back as Chief Arbiter for game 11.

During the game Zukhar sat in row 7; during the following games he
gradually moved into rows 4 and 5.

Berginer was in the audience for the first time during game 12.

Almost a week later, on the morning when games 13 & 14 were to be
resumed, Leeuwerik said, 'Korchnoi is now convinced that neither
Zukhar nor Berginer can have any effect upon a player during the
game'.

Berginer left Baguio after game 14.

<P> 
During game 16, Zukhar sat in row 4 in clear view of Korchnoi, and was
tickled and kicked by Leeuwerik.

When he sat in the fifth row at the start of game 17, Korchnoi
announced to Filip that he would refuse to play until Zukhar was moved
farther back.

Filip, who was standing in for Schmid, started Korchnoi's clock. 

Shaking his fist, Korchnoi said, 'No matter what your jury thinks the
rules say, I tell you this man disturbs me. If he is not moved within
10 minutes, then I will move him.'

Campomanes decided that no spectator would be seated closer than the
seventh row during the game.

The delay cost Korchnoi 11 minutes on clock.

<P> 
After game 17 the jury held another meeting to consider a Campomanes
letter stating that he would no longer have spectators moved.

Korchnoi appointed Keene to replace Leeuwerik on the jury, while
Korchnoi and Leeuwerik stayed in Manila during Korchnoi's double
timeout.

Before leaving for Manila, Leeuwerik submitted a protest about
Zukhar's presence and about excessive radiation levels in the playing
hall.

<P> 
At another jury meeting, Keene withdrew the protest and requested the
jury to 'help Korchnoi by keeping Zukhar in the background during
playing sessions'.

On the same day Korchnoi & Leeuwerik held a press conference in Manila
attacking Zukhar and requesting that 'The organizers install a one-way
mirror between the stage and the audience'.

Korchnoi declared, 'I will not play if a one-way mirror is not
installed'.

<P>
After consultation with Korchnoi, Keene issued a communique together
with Baturinsky where they agreed that

<UL>
<LI>there would be no mirror,</LI>
<LI>Zukhar would remain in the seats assigned to the Soviet delegation, and</LI>
<LI>Korchnoi would remove his sunglasses.</LI>
</UL>

Starting with game 18, Zukhar sat with the Soviet delegation.

<P>
When Korchnoi requested his first timeout after game 17, Campomanes
sought advice in Manila from experts on parapsychology. 

He received an opinion from Jaime Bulatao, a professor in the Department
of Psychology at Manila University, saying that Zukhar could
very well be disturbing Korchnoi, although not necessarily by telepathic
means.

By coincidence, Korchnoi also visited Bulatao who suggested the
one-way mirror to separate him from the spectators.

<P> 
When play resumed for game 18, Rita Mataragnon, who worked for
Bulatao, was present in Baguio, seated in the fifth row.

Another associate of Bulatao, a Belgian whose identity can not be confirmed, was present for game 19,
along with groups of young psychology students.

Karpov sent a letter to Schmid after game 20 complaining about the
students.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">Ananda Marga</FONT></H3>

<P>
Steven Dwyer & Victoria Shepherd, also known as Dada & Didi, were
American members of the Ananda Marga, an Indian sect.

Wearing white garments and saffron robes, they attended the 18th game.

Dwyer spent much of the game in meditation, while Shepherd
concentrated on Zukhar and the players.

<P>
The couple had been tried in February on charges of stabbing an Indian
diplomat, the First Secretary of the Indian Embassy in the
Philippines, in Manila. 

Their objective had been to draw the attention of public opinion and
to free one of their leaders, imprisoned in an Indian jail.

They had been convicted of attempted murder by a Philippine court and
each sentenced to 17 years imprisonment.

Their case had been appealed and they were released on bail pending a
hearing or retrial.

<P> 
During the four day break between the second session of game 18 and game
19, Dwyer & Shepherd gave lessons in transcendental meditation to
Korchnoi.

They also moved into Korchnoi's hotel.

<P> 
When Shepherd arrived for game 19, her bag was searched, but she was
admitted to the playing hall.

Dwyer was stopped by security until Leeuwerik intervened -- 'He is our
friend and has just as much right to see the match as Zukhar'.

When she threatened to disturb the game, which was already in
progress, Dwyer was allowed to enter, and was seated by Leeuwerik near
the Soviet delegation.

Security men placed themselves near Dwyer & Shepherd, as well as
around the Soviets.

Baturinsky told Campomanes that he did not feel secure with the
Ananda Marga paying so much attention to the Soviet delegation.

<P>
At the request of Campomanes, the jury met before game 20.

He wanted an opinion on whether the two members of Ananda Marga should
be allowed into the playing hall.

Before the game started, he announced that 'we have decided to
disallow entrance into the Karpov - Korchnoi games by persons of known
criminal record'.

Korchnoi, who was not aware of the decision, wore a saffron colored
necktie during game 20.

Leeuwerik wore a saffron colored dress during game 21.

<P>
Between games 21 & 22 Campomanes warned in a letter to the jury that
the match would be terminated unless the Ananda Marga 'question is
resolved by the jury'.

The warning was partly precipitated by a threatening phone call which
his wife had received.

The next day Keene informed Campomanes that 'the two members of the
Ananda Marga will be departing from [Korchnoi's] Hotel this afternoon'
and promised that they would maintain a 'low profile'.

Campomanes authorized the 22nd game to be played as scheduled, while
Dwyer & Shepherd moved into Korchnoi's villa.

The tension about their presence subsided considerably.

<P>
After game 31 was adjourned, Dwyer & Shepherd, accompanied by Korchnoi
& Leeuwerik, were again seen at the Pines [Korchnoi's] Hotel by
Campomanes.

He immediately informed Keene that the Ananda Marga would no longer be
permitted at the villa nor could they use official cars.

Campomanes said, 'Whatever takes place, Korchnoi and his friends have
brought it upon him. I'm fed up with taking shots from them. This
time, I will take my shot at them and they can worry about the
consequences.'

Keene promised that they would move out the next day.

Euwe also asked Campomanes to take no action until the adjourned game
was finished.

<P>
The day after Korchnoi won the adjourned position to tie the match at
5-5, Campomanes held a press conference and released a statement that
'Dwyer and Shepherd have violated [Keene's] letter of assurance that
they would [...] maintain a low profile'.

Dwyer responded that he would 'undertake to avoid any presence [...]
in the Pines Hotel'.

<P>
The next day Korchnoi held a press conference at his villa.

Dwyer & Shepherd demonstrated to American television cameras the yoga
exercises which they had taught Korchnoi.

This was not what had been understood as a 'low profile'.


<P>
Balashov requested an urgent meeting of the jury, which convened the
following day -- the same day on which the 32nd game was scheduled to
start.

Baturinsky 'requested that Mr. Dwyer and Ms. Shepherd be ejected from
Baguio City [...] before the beginning of game 32. If this was not
done, Mr. Karpov would not continue the match and the entire question
would be submitted to the FIDE Congress in November.'

One hour before the game was scheduled to start, Keene delivered a
letter that 'the two Ananda Margii left this afternoon by private
car'.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">Game 32 & afterwards</FONT></H3>

<P>
After the 32nd game started, Zukhar moved from the seating area for the
Soviet delegation to the fourth row.

Balashov's letter had stated, 'The Soviet side considers the
challenger's delegation relationship with the criminal elements
contradicts the contents of the joint communique signed on August 31,
1978, [...] which stressed the desire to normalize the further course
of the match'.

Or, as <A HREF="wcc-blio.htm#kar-fbtm">Baturinsky put it</A>, 'the
Soviet delegation considered that, through the fault of the
challenger, the agreement [of 31 August], had lost its validity, and
on this basis Professor Zukhar again took his seat nearer to the
stage' (p.80).

<P>
Korchnoi adjourned the 32nd game in a lost position.

The next morning Keene reported that Korchnoi would not be resuming
the game.
 
Filip & Kazic informed the match principals that 'Korchnoi will not
resume the adjourned 32nd game'.

<P>
On the same day Korchnoi sent a letter to Filip stating

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I don't resume the 32nd game but I am not going to sign the score
sheet of the game because it has been played under absolutely illegal
conditions. I don't consider the game valid. The match is not finished.
I reserve the right to complain to FIDE on the intolerable Soviets'
behavior, a hostility of the organizers, a lack of activity of the
arbiters.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Stean read a letter from Korchnoi to the press blaming Campomanes
for making 'a mockery of this match'.

Campomanes's replied, 'I can only forgive Korchnoi, for I know it is
not easy to lose such a closely fought match.'

<P>
The next day Korchnoi wrote another letter to Filip, 'I protest
against the unfair and unequal conditions of the 1978 World Chess
Championship Match. [...] I consider the 32nd game of this match not
valid because of these circumstances.'

For some reason, Keene also sent a letter to a sponsor stating

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In order to set the records straight, I am hereby informing you that
Viktor Korchnoi lost the 32nd game in complete ignorance of the
pseudojudicial proceedings that morning and afternoon by the jury.
Neither was he ever cognizant of the fact that Zukhar was sitting in
the 4th row during the game.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Korchnoi left the Philippines without attending the closing ceremony
and without receiving his prize money.

The organizers made the check conditional on accepting the match
result.

During the ceremony Keene made a speech that was written without
Korchnoi's knowledge.

Karpov was crowned with a floral, instead of laurel, wreath.

<P>
Keene left Korchnoi's team.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I was placed under the intolerable strain of defending, on
[Korchnoi's] behalf, the two members of the Ananda Marga sect [...
which] culminated in my eventual resignation from the joint post of
chief second and jury representative and my unequivocal disassociation
from his effort to demand a replay over the Zukhar issue' (p.20)

<CENTER><B>***</B></CENTER>

At the end of the 1978 match I notified the organizers of my
resignation from the post of Korchnoi's Chief Second / Jury
Representative. At the same time I also wrote to Korchnoi. In this
note I declined any payment for the match from his part of the prize
fund and suggested that he donate the money to his Ananda Marga gurus.

In November, the FIDE Congress and Olympiad were held at Buenos Aires.

The Swiss Chess Federation raised a protest on behalf of Korchnoi for
consideration by the Congress.

Campomanes lodged another protest against Korchnoi to the
Congress.

Korchnoi, who was now represented by the Swiss lawyer Alan Brodbeck,
also initiated legal proceedings in an Amsterdam court against FIDE and
Karpov.

<P>
In Buenos Aires the General Assembly 'declared the match finished with
a score of 6-5 and declared Mr. Karpov winner of the match'.

It asked the FIDE Bureau to examine the Chief Arbiter's report and the
protests by Korchnoi and Campomanes.

Korchnoi played first board for Switzerland in the Olympiad and won the
gold medal.

A few months later, he also won the 1978 chess Oscar, which Karpov had
won for each of the five previous years.

<P>
In February 1979, the FIDE Bureau met in Graz, listened to Brodbeck, and
unanimously decided that

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Considering that both heads of delegations had concluded a private
accord compromising among other things that Dr Zukhar, not an official
member of the Soviet delegation, had to be seated in one of the rear
rows of the hall because the Challenger had declared that he felt
disturbed by  the nearness of Dr Zukhar;

<P>
Considering that during the whole 32nd game Dr Zukhar was seated in
one of the front rows;

<P>
Considering that from the point of view of the Challenger and his
delegation this behavior of Dr Zukhar could very well be considered
as a disturbance;

<P>
Considering, however, that neither the Challenger nor any members of
his delegation, who were present in the hall, protested against it
during the whole game;

<P>
The Bureau unanimously came to the conclusion that during the 32nd
game both the Match Regulations and the Rules of Play of FIDE were
respected and fully enforced.

<P>
The World Chess Championship Match between Karpov and Korchnoi in
Baguio 1978 was prepared and organized in a thoroughly excellent
manner by the Chess Federation of the Philippine Republic.

<P>
After a painstaking examination, the FIDE Bureau confirms that the
Jury and Panel of Arbiters aIso fulfilled their duties in an objective
and effective manner.

<P>
Under these circumstances, we must condemn premeditated actions and
omissions on the part of the Challenger within the framework of the
World Chess Championship which did not conform to the sporting ethics
of chess and general social obligations and which also damaged the
dignity and prestige of FIDE.

<P>
The FlDE Bureau regrets the Challenger's attitude and severely
admonishes Mr Korchnoi to conduct himself in a correct manner in aIl
future chess matches.

<P>
A few months later the Amsterdam Committee issued improvements on the
1978 match regulations.

These included

expanded arbiter powers to act on disturbances,

mandatory attendance of the players at opening and closing ceremonies,

a deposit of 500 SFR for any protest to be returned if considered well
founded,

an appeal jury of only three neutral members,

and a new rule about starting clocks in the absence of a signed
scoresheet.

<P>
In August 1981, during game 12 of the
<A HREF="7981$wix.htm">Karpov - Korchnoi match in Merano</A>,
the Amsterdam court delivered its verdict.

It rejected Korchnoi's action concerning Baguio and directed that
legal costs were to be paid by Korchnoi.

The 1978 match was finally finished.
