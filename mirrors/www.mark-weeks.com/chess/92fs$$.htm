"Fischer is back! It's an event we have all eagerly awaited for 20
years..."
</CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
After disappearing from public view for 20 years, Robert James Fischer
returned to play a chess match with Boris Spassky in 1992. At the time
of the return match, Fischer was 49 years old. Spassky was 55, was
ranked 101st in the world, and had a rating of 2560.

<P>
They came to the town of Sveti Stefan, a resort off the coast of
Montenegro, 110 km from the civil war in Bosnia, 200 km from besieged
Sarajevo. Fischer played despite United Nations sanctions against
Yugoslavia and a warning from the United States Treasury Department,
which threatened him with severe penalties for playing.

<P>
The prize fund was 5.000.000 US$, of which the first player to win 10
games would receive 3.650.000 US$. In the event of a 9-9 tie, Fischer
would keep his title as "undefeated champion of the world". There
would be no adjournments.

<P>
The match sponsor was Jezdimir Vasiljevic, President of Jugoskandic
Bank, and a crony of Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic. The match
arbiter was Lothar Schmid, who had performed the same function 20
years earlier in Iceland. Eugenio Torre, GM from the Philippines,
served as Fischer's second, while Spassky had Borislav Ivkov as his
second.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">
A memorable press conference
</FONT></H3>

<P>
On 1 September 1992, Fischer gave his first press conference in 20
years. When asked about his reaction to the threats by Washington,
Fischer took out a letter from the Treasury Department and spat on it.

<P>
He accused Kasparov and Karpov of playing "prearranged" matches, and
accused Karpov and Korchnoi of the same. Spassky supported the opinion
by pointing out the finish of the 19th game of the
<A HREF="90kk$$.htm">1990 match</A>
in Lyon.

<P>
When asked about his reputation as an anti-Communist, Fischer said
"Soviet Communism is basically a mask for Bolshevism which is a mask
for Judaism." Asked later about his apparent anti-Semitism, he said,
"I'm definitely not anti-Arab, OK?"

<P>
He accused the Soviets of keeping his royalties from his book "My 60
Memorable Games", and said that there would be no possibility of a
match with Kasparov unless the royalties were paid.

<P>
On 2 September 1992, the New York Times published an editorial.

Bosnia's Tragedy, and Bobby's
</CENTER>

<P>
Think of Bosnia overrun by Serbian-backed militias. Then think of the
chess genius Bobby Fischer violating United Nations sanctions, and
decency itself, to play a chess match for profit in Serbia against his
old rival Boris Spassky.

<P>
The contrast reeks of callousness, not to mention disregard for
international law. The match also violates President Bush's executive
order forbidding Americans to do business in Yugoslavia.

<P>
The Yugoslav entrepreneur Jezdimir Vasiljevic is trying to recast the
match as a charity event by pledging to donate $600,000 to refugee
relief. This changes almost nothing. With its lucrative revenues from
sponsor fees and television rights, and its purse of $5 million, the
match is a business venture, pure and simple.

<P>
Mr. Fischer captivated chess enthusiasts and ordinary citizens
everywhere when he defeated Mr. Spassky to become world champion 20
years ago. Today he embarrasses the world. Asked about a Federal
ruling forbidding him to play, Mr. Fischer held up the notice and spat
on it. If he plays, he deserves prosecution under the law. That could
mean a $250,000 fine and 10 years in jail.

<P>
That would also be another sad episode in a strange career. Personal
problems have long overshadowed Mr. Fischer's talents. He was stripped
of the world title in 1975 because he declined to defend it. Eccentric
and reclusive, he became a member of an extremist religious sect, then
an ardent purveyor of anti-Semitic dogma. He hasn't played in public
for two decades.

<P>
But eccentrics, too, are subject to the law. If Mr. Fischer plays, it
is only right to make him pay.

One chess fan summed up the reaction of the chess world in a letter to
<I>Chess Life</I>, "Fischer is back! It's an event we have all eagerly
awaited for 20 years. And now that he's back, I already wish he would
go away again."

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">
The Fischer chess clock
</FONT></H3>

<P>
The match was the first chess event to use the "Bobby Fischer chess
clock". The clock had been patented by Fischer in the U.S. in 1989,
but a working model had never been constructed. A clock was made for
the event in a working time of five days.

<P>
The purpose of the clock was to ensure that a player always had at
least one minute for the next move. Time scrambles, where a player had
only seconds to reach the next time control, were thereby eliminated.

<P>
The terms of the match were that:-
<BR>- each player starts with 111 minutes on the clock
<BR>- after each move, 1 minute is added
<BR>- after move 40, 40 minutes are added
<BR>- after move 60, 30 minutes are added
<BR>- after move 80, 20 minutes are added

<P>
This meant that each player had 150 minutes, or 2 1/2 hours, for the
first 40 moves. This was a standard time control for world class chess
events.

After the second game Fischer threatened to bar journalists and to

proclaiming "World Chess Championship", and the match continued.

The 4th game was Fischer's first loss in 20 years. He said, "That's
chess; one day you give a lesson, and the next day you get a lesson."
He got another lesson in the 5th game, then gave lessons in the 7th,
8th, and 9th games.

Ten days later on 30 September, the match resumed in Belgrade at the
Sava Business Center. Fischer had preferred Belgrade over Reykjavik in
1972.

<P>
The press room in the Sava Center was underused. As one
photojournalist remarked, "Why would journalists want to come here? No
photos, no interviews, what would they do?"

During the 14th game on the 14th move, Fischer proposed a draw to
Spassky, which Spassky accepted. Fischer reminded him that the match
rules stipulated that if a game was agreed drawn less one hour after
the start, the players must immediately begin another game, colors
reversed.

<P>
Spassky, who was playing White, withdrew the agreement to draw, saying
"But you'll kill me with White". Fischer later said, "The draw hadn't
been finalized, because we didn't shake hands".
