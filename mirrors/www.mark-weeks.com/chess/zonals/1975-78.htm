There was a (I believe 4 game) playoff for 2nd place between Parma and Liberzon in Athens, Greece 1976. Only two games are known - a win for Parma and a draw. But it was Liberzon who played in Interzonal. Did Parma forfeit the match, or did Liberzon win both missing games and thus won the playoff, or did Parma win the playoff but later declined to play?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The initial, cursory documentation of the preceding event led to several unclear, related points involving 
(1) 1975 Barcelona;
(2) 1976 Arandjelovac; and
(3) IZ Qualifiers.

For example (September 2011):-

<P>
<B>EK:</B>
Why some players didn't/couldn't participate in Barcelona and then played a separate tournament? Is that from Arandjelovac just a playoff or main tournament by players who didn't play in Barcelona? If it is only playoff, where was the main tournament played? Also Arandjelovac? And the standings? How did Uhlmann edge out Smejkal and Adorjan? 
&#149;
Also why did Pachman play in Interzonal? Did Diez del Corral decline?

<B>MW:</B>
All good questions. One correction: Smejkal played in the 1976 Biel IZ; Uhlmann played in the 1976 Manila IZ. Neither qualified from another event. So if Arandjelovac had something to do with the zonal process, why didn't Adorjan qualify?
[See 'IZ Qualifiers', below, for a response from EK.]

Points don't add up for group 1. If there were really 12 players then the total sum should be 66, but it is 76! So it looks like there were 13 players (like in group 2) meaning that the total sum should be 78. So they forgot to list a player who scored 2 points.

There was a committee (Euwe, Averbakh, Elo, Matanovic, Golombek) that nominated some players. Looks like that this time they nominated 7 players (Tal, Geller, Larsen, Ljubojevic, Hort, Huebner, Kuzmin). Kuzmin declined (why?) and was replaced by 1st reserve Kavalek. But then they somehow additionally added 2nd reserve Smejkal, and to balance the number of players in the two Interzonals they added 3rd reserve Smyslov too. Is this correct? And again, what was the exact order of those nominated players?

Smejkal played in the Interzonal as one of the nominated players by the FIDE Committee. Committee nominated Tal, Geller, Larsen, Ljubojevic, Hort, Huebner and Kuzmin. Kuzmin was replaced by Kavalek (1st reserve). But then somehow Smejkal (who was at that time the highest rated player not already qualified for the Interzonal) and Smyslov came in additionaly. I somewhere read that Smejkal was the 2nd reserve and that Smyslov was the 3rd reserve. If this is true they must have first additionally added Smejkal and then to balance the number of players in both Interzonals, they added Smyslov too. But maybe it was the other way around – maybe Soviet Union (again!) somehow brought Smyslov into the cycle, and then Smejkal was brought in to balance the number of players. Anyway it must have been Sosonko (Barcelona) and Uhlman (Arandjelovac) who have qualified from the zonal, and for some reason Pachman too.

Probably there were 2 tickets awarded in Barcelona (like it was originally meant to be) and Pachmann came in as replacement for Diez del Corral. Situation is similar to cycle 5 only that here nothing was annuled. But all the complications did "create" one additional qualifying spot (3 instead of 2).
