<P>
Korchnoi had White in the first game, as he also had in the two
previous matches.

<P><CENTER><B>Game  1 - Queen's Gambit Declined</B></CENTER>

<P>
The opening followed game 1 of the 1978 match.

Korchnoi was the first to vary with 9.Be2.

Karpov could have forced the line from the previous game with
9...dxc4, but he chose another alternative.

Karpov accepted hanging pawns, proceeded to outplay Korchnoi, and broke
through with ...d4.

<P>
He then broke up White's king position, won a pawn, and gained an
attack.

Korchnoi resigned after considering his sealed moves for several
minutes.

After one game, Karpov led 1-0.

<P>
In his annotations to the first game Karpov remarked, "During the
match I noticed that Korchnoi frequently avoided tactical
complications, although formerly he used to pride himself on his
calculating ability".

<P><CENTER><B>Game  2 - Ruy Lopez</B></CENTER>

<P>
Korchnoi avoided the Open Variation that he had used eight times
in the previous match, and chose instead the Rio Variation of the Berlin
Defence.

Karpov built a strong positional advantage.

In a difficult position, Korchnoi blundered a pawn.

<P>
Karpov sealed his 42nd move with an extra pawn and continued
accurately in the second session.

Korchnoi resigned on his 57th move to give Karpov a 2-0 lead.

<P><CENTER><B>Game  3 - Queen's Gambit Declined</B></CENTER>

<P>
The game followed game 1 until Karpov chose on his 9th move to repeat
game 1 of the 1978 match.

Korchnoi obtained a favorable position, but was unable to gain
anything concrete against Karpov's accurate defence.

At one point Karpov offered a draw, but Korchnoi replied that draws
should only be made through the arbiter.

The game was drawn anyway in the face of a triple repetition.

In fact, Karpov claimed the draw although the position was being
reached for only the second time, but by the time this was discovered,
Korchnoi had already signed the scoresheets and left the hall.

<P><CENTER><B>Game  4 - Petrov's Defence</B></CENTER>

<P>
The players followed game 6 of the 1974 match until Korchnoi varied on
his 8th move.

Karpov provoked the advance of Korchnoi's queenside pawns and obtained a
slight advantage.

Karpov felt that his position was not enough to win, but since his
opponent was insisting that draws be offered through the arbiter, he
played on.

Korchnoi decided to complicate the game by launching a kingside
attack, but it was Karpov who got an attack against Korchnoi's exposed
king.

By the time Korchnoi sealed his 41st move, he had a lost game.

He resigned before reaching the time control in the second session.

Karpov now had a 3-0 lead.

<P>
Korchnoi took a timeout.

<P><CENTER><B>Game  5 - Queen's Gambit Declined</B></CENTER>

<P>
The opening followed ideas similar to game 13 of the 1978 match,
without the 8.Bxf6 Bxf6 of that previous game.

With g3, Korchnoi started to fianchetto his bishop, but then allowed
it be exchanged for its counterpart on a6.

Karpov sacrificed a pawn, which Korchnoi returned immediately.

After the queens were exchanged, the game settled into a 2R+N+Pefgh
vs. 2R+N+Pafgh endgame.

Korchnoi exchanged a pair of rooks and the knights to win the a-pawn,
but was unable to win the resulting position, which was a theoretical
draw.

He agreed to split the point after 68 moves.

<P><CENTER><B>Game  6 - Ruy Lopez</B></CENTER>

<P>
Korchnoi had lost the first two games where he had the Black
pieces, so he returned to the Open Lopez.

He played 12...Bg6 instead of the move he had played three times in
the previous match, the last time in the 14th game.

He steered into a line which he had recommended as better for White in
ECO, but Karpov chose another variation.

Although both players had apparently analyzed the ensuing moves in
preparation for the match, Korchnoi proceeded to outplay Karpov and
sacrificed a pawn to gain an advantage.

Just before the time control and in severe time trouble, he gave Karpov
an opportunity which would have turned the game completely around.

<P>
Karpov missed the chance, Korchnoi sealed his 41st move, and Karpov
resigned before the second session started.

It was Korchnoi's first full point in the match, but Karpov still led
3-1.

<P><CENTER><B>Game  7 - Queen's Gambit Declined</B></CENTER>

<P>
The opening followed game 5 until Karpov varied on his 13th move.

Karpov accepted hanging pawns and used them to open the position at the
appropriate time.

Korchnoi had the better position, but Karpov defended accurately.

After his 31st move, Korchnoi offered a draw through the arbiter,
which Karpov accepted.

The final position seemed very sharp and some spectators assumed that
Korchnoi had won.

<P>
Karpov took a timeout.

<P><CENTER><B>Game  8 - Giuoco Piano</B></CENTER>

<P>
Karpov avoided the Spanish Game and chose a Giuoco Pianissimo, which
became even quieter after the early exchange of queens.

Condemned to 'a tedious search for equality' (Karpov), Korchnoi
misplayed and gave Karpov an endgame advantage.

Karpov hesitated to follow the strongest plan and allowed Korchnoi to
escape unscathed from severe time trouble.

Korchnoi thought for a long time before sealing his 41st move and was
again in time trouble during the second session.

By the time the second time control was reached, the game had settled
into an ending of 2N+4P each.

<P>
Karpov managed to win a pawn, but agreed to a draw in a 2N+P vs.
2N endgame, where Korchnoi could have sacrificed both knights for the
pawn to obtain a theoretical draw.

<P><CENTER><B>Game  9 - Queen's Gambit Declined</B></CENTER>

<P>
The players followed game 7 until Karpov deviated from known theory on
his 7th move.

Korchnoi accepted an isolated d-pawn, but instead of forcing its
exchange into an equal game, he sought complications.

All of the minor pieces were exchanged leaving a position of Q+2R+6P
each.

Faced with the loss of his isolated pawn, Korchnoi defended by opening
his kingside.

Karpov penetrated with his heavy pieces and Korchnoi resigned on his
44th move.

Karpov now led 4-1.

<P>
Korchnoi took a timeout.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 10 - Giuoco Piano</B></CENTER>

<P>
The opening followed game 8 with transpositions and slight modifications until
Karpov varied by accepting the exchange of the light squared bishops.

The queens were exchanged a few moves later and by move 24 the game
settled into a R+N endgame.

It was agreed drawn on the 32nd move.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 11 - Queen's Gambit Declined</B></CENTER>

<P>
The game followed game 23 of the 1978 match until move 13, when Karpov
repeated the line from game 9 of that match.

Karpov then varied from game 9 on his 14th move, following an idea
which Huebner had played against Korchnoi during game 6 of the
<A HREF="7981$cix.htm">final candidates match</A>.

Korchnoi varied immediately from the Huebner game, the queens were
exchanged, and Korchnoi won a pawn, for which Karpov had excellent
compensation.

Karpov switched to 1.c4 for the first and only time in the match.

On his 4th move he deviated from game 30 of the previous match.

He gradually developed a positional advantage, but Korchnoi defended
accurately.

Karpov won a pawn, but it was not enough to win the game.

Korchnoi sealed his 41st move, but the game was agreed drawn a few
moves into the second session.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 13 - Queen's Gambit Declined</B></CENTER>

<P>
Korchnoi repeated the Exchange Variation which he had played in
game 31 of the previous match, but varied with 5.Bf4.

He gradually outplayed Karpov and had a won position by the 22nd move.

He then allowed Karpov a series of tactical strokes.

Karpov failed to find the miraculous 29th move and gave up his queen
for rook and knight.

Korchnoi sealed his 42nd move, winning the knight, and Karpov resigned
without continuing.

He had been unable to find a fortress to save the Q vs. R endgame.

<P>
This was Korchnoi's first win with the White pieces in the match.

Karpov now led 4-2.

<P>
Karpov took a timeout

<P><CENTER><B>Game 14 - Ruy Lopez</B></CENTER>

<P>
The opening saw another Open Lopez, where Karpov avoided the variation
from game 6 and returned to a line last seen in game 10 of the 1978
match.

He varied from that game on his 11th move.

Korchnoi thought for 78 minutes on his 13th move, which became his
personal record for the three matches with Karpov.

By his 16th move he was already in some trouble and Karpov's surprise
17th move almost won by force.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 15 - English Opening</B></CENTER>
