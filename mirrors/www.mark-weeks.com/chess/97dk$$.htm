<P>
After beating Deep Blue in 1996, Kasparov offered a rematch, which
IBM accepted.

Fifteen months after the 1996 Philadelphia match, the 'IBM Challenge
Rematch' was played at the Equitable Center, Seventh Avenue, New York,
NY.

<P>
In fact, of the two opponents, only Kasparov was physically present in
New York City.

Deep Blue remained at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown
Heights, NY.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">
Deep Blue's team
</FONT></H3>

<P>
IBM's team was largely the same as for the previous match against
Kasparov.

Chung-Jen (C.J.) Tan, Senior Manager of the Parallel Systems Platforms
Department, was responsible for managing the team.

Murray Campbell, research scientist,
Gershon "Jerry" Brody, circuit engineer,
Joseph Hoane, Jr., software engineer, and
GM Joel Benjamin, Deep Blue's tutor,
were also members of the team.

<P>
Feng-Hsiung (C.B.) Hsu, was the architect and principle designer of
Deep Blue.

He had received a Ph.D in 1989 from Carnegie Mellon University, for
research on parallel search algorithms.

His Deep Thought, the Deep Blue predecessor, was the first computer to
earn a GM level rating in 1988.

It also beat IM David Levy 4-0 in 1989, to win a famous challenge
which had been outstanding since 1968.

Hsu was the 1991 winner of the ACM's prestigious Grace Murray Hopper
Award.

<P>
Deep Blue's strength was based on the the Power Two Super Chip (P2SC)
processor.

Thirty-two processing nodes calculated 200 million moves per second or
36 billion moves for the three minutes that the machine was allowed
for thinking.

This meant that it was able to conduct an exhaustive 12 ply (equal to
12 half moves) search, which was a quantitative improvement over the
10 ply for the model in the 1996 match.

<P>
Playing White in the first game, Kasparov sacrificed an exchange in
return for pressure against the the computer's King and won nicely.

Kasparov resigned game 2 in a position where he could have reached a
draw by perpetual check. Many observers suspected that he was spooked
by the strength of his electronic opponent.

In game 3 Kasparov opened with the rare 1.d3 and achieved an
advantage, but was unable to find a win. The game ended in a draw.

Game 4 was also a draw.

Kasparov played an unusual variation of the Caro Kann and achieved an
advantage, but was unable to win a rook and pawn endgame,

<P>
The sixth game was one of the shortest defeats of Kasparov's career.

He played a known line in the Caro Kann, an opening which had never
been part of his repertoire.

For reasons known only to himself, he allowed a crushing knight
sacrifice on the eighth move which has always won for White and which
was probably included in Deep Blue's opening database.

After struggling in a hopeless game, he resigned on his 19th move.

<P>
A machine had accomplished what no person has ever done - defeat
Kasparov in a chess match.

<P>
After the game Kasparov said, "I was surprised by the second game. It
had a profound impact on my psychology."

He blamed his loss on a lack of prematch preparation, and was
apparently caught off guard by the serious approach IBM took for the
match.

He also accused Deep Blue of having had human assistance during the
match and demanded to see the software logs.

<P>
Many world class chess players agreed that Kasparov did not play like
Kasparov.

His strategy had been to get the machine out of its opening database as
early as possible, to play middle game positions where strategy is more
important than tactics, and to reach endgames where qualitative
factors outweigh the quantitative.

<P>
In games 3 through 5, Kasparov apparently fell victim to the well
known horizon factor, which is a double edged sword peculiar to a
computer's brute force approach to chess.

It works against the machine when disadvantageous positions are pushed
outside the software's search tree by introducing inconsequential
moves into the critical branches.

It works for the machine when the inconsequential moves make the
likely result harder to find for the human.

<P>
Deep Blue's team won 700.000 US$; Kasparov won 400.000 US$.

IBM estimated that the corporation received 50.000.000 US$ worth of
publicity during the match.
