<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The match marked the first battle between two Soviet players for the
world championship title since the <A HREF="6769$wix.htm">1969
Spassky-Petrosian</A> title match.

The games were played in the Hall of Columns, Trade Union House,
Moscow.

<P>
At the time of the match, Karpov was 33 years old and rated 2705. Kasparov was
21 years old and rated 2715.

<P>
The first player to win six games would win the match, with no limit
to the number of games.

The first time control was 40 moves in 2 1/2 hours followed by 16
moves in 1 hour.

<P>
Karpov's seconds were I. Zaitsev and Y. Balashov.

Kasparov's trainer was Alexander Nikitin, who also served as chief
second, assisted by G. Timoshenko.

<P>
Chief Arbiter was S. Gligoric, assisted by Y. Averbakh and V. Mikenas.

Gligoric had also served as arbiter for the
<A HREF="8284$cix.htm">1983 Kasparov-Korchnoi</A>
candidates semifinal match.

R. Toran served as president of the appeals committee

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">
Games 1-9; Karpov jumps to a 4-0 lead
</FONT></H3>

<P>
Karpov had White in the first game which was played on 10 September.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 1 - Sicilian Defense</B></CENTER>

<P>
The game entered the Keres Attack of the Scheveningen Variation with
6.g4.

In 1982, Kasparov and Nikitin had published a book on the opening,
appropriately titled 'Everything about the Scheveningen'.

<P>
Of the move which Kasparov played in this first match game they had written,
'8...h5 does not, in our opinion, solve Black's opening problems',
giving 8...d5 with a '!' as the best move.

Karpov varied from their published analysis on his 11th move, following a
1983 game by two Soviet players. Kasparov steered the game into new
territory with his 15th move.

<P>
Neither player was able to gain an advantage.

With two minutes remaining for each player after the 36th move, Kasparov
offered a draw and Karpov accepted.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 2 - Queen's Indian Defense</B></CENTER>

<P>
On his 7th move, Kasparov played a speculative pawn sacrifice which had been
known since game 12 of the
<A HREF="7981$cix.htm">1980 Korchnoi-Polugaevsky</A>
semifinal match, where Polugaevsky won brilliantly with the White
pieces.

Kasparov varied from previous games with his 13th move.

Kasparov missed a chance to gain an advantage on his 21st move, instead
allowing Karpov to gain the advantage with his move.

<P>
Kasparov sacrificed the exchange on move 26 and the game became very sharp.

Although commentators disagree on the best move sequences, Karpov probably
missed chances to win, and had to return some material to avoid being
checkmated.

<P>
The game was adjourned in a position where Kasparov's sealed move (41.Rxf6)
was forced.

Most analysts expected Karpov to win, but Kasparov found a perpetual check a few
moves into the second session.

This was a superb tactical struggle.

<P>
Kasparov took his first timeout for game 3, when he came down with the
flu.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 3 - Sicilian Defense</B></CENTER>

<P>
Karpov played a Maroczy bind in the Taimanov Variation and Kasparov countered
with a Hedgehog Defense.

Karpov built up a strong position and Kasparov, after considering his move for 50
minutes, sacrificed a pawn to obtain counterplay.

<P>
Karpov kept the initiative, won the game in 31 moves, and led 1-0.

<P>
It was Karpov's turn to catch a flu and he took a timeout for game 4.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 4 - Queen's Indian Defense</B></CENTER>

<P>
Karpov varied from game 2 with 4...Ba6. On his 21st move, Kasparov initiated a
series of pawn sacrifices which Karpov was obliged to refuse.

With opposite colored bishops and all of the heavy pieces on the
board, Kasparov gained a slight advantage because of a centralized bishop.

<P>
The game was adjourned with Karpov sealing his 41st move, but was drawn a
few moves into the second session, on Kasparov's proposition.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 5 - Sicilian Defense</B></CENTER>

<P>
The opening was another Scheveningen Variation.

This time Kasparov varied from his published analysis on the 11th
move.

The game was drawn after 21 moves, proposed by Kasparov.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 6 - Queen's Indian Defense</B></CENTER>

<P>
Karpov varied from game 2 with 7...O-O. Kasparov sacrificed a pawn for an
attack, then immediately missed the best line on his 27th move.

A few moves later Kasparov offered a draw, which Karpov declined.

<P>
The game was adjourned in a R+Pfgh vs. R+Pagh endgame, with Karpov sealing
his 42nd move.

Karpov won a classic endgame after 70 moves and led 2-0.

Because Karpov had avoided defeat and had gone on to win, this was
considered a critical game in the early stage of the match.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 7 - Queen's Gambit Declined</B></CENTER>

<P>
Karpov switched to 1.d4, allowing the Tarrasch Defense (3...c5), which Kasparov
had used in all three candidates matches.

After using 30 minutes on each of his 15th and 16th moves, Kasparov
sacrificed the isolated pawn on d5.

Kasparov recovered the pawn, but left Karpov well centralized.

In some time pressure, Kasparov blundered with 35...Rc2.

Karpov penetrated with his queen and started winning Black's Q-side pawns.

Kasparov sealed his 42nd move, but resigned without continuing.

Karpov now led 3-0.

Kasparov took his second timeout.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 8 - Catalan Opening</B></CENTER>

<P>
Kasparov switched to 3.g3, avoiding the Queen's Indian Defense, and the game
continued quietly.

Kasparov offered a draw on the 20th move, which Karpov accepted.

This was the first game where Kasparov played for a short draw with the
White pieces.

There would be many more such games in this ill-starred match.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 9 - Queen's Gambit Declined</B></CENTER>

<P>
The players followed game 7, until Karpov varied with 15.Bd4. Kasparov replied
instantly, showing that he was prepared for the continuation.

Karpov avoided winning Black's isolated d-pawn on his 22nd move, playing
to keep the pawn under fire.

<P>
In an endgame with B+N+6Ps for each player,
Kasparov sealed his 42nd move, which was not the most accurate.

After 46.b4, Kasparov blundered with 46...gxh4, and Karpov obtained a decisive
advantage.

Karpov switched to 1.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 and steered into an English opening.

his pawn structure.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">
Why was Kasparov making short draws?
</FONT></H3>

<P>
After Kasparov's third consecutive short draw with the White pieces,
speculation started as to the reason behind Kasparov's match tactics.

<P>
On 13 October, between games 12 and 13, Harry Golombek wrote in <I>The
London Times</I> that Kasparov was faced with threats against his family if
he should win the match.

FIDE President Florencio Campomanes refuted the theory in a letter to
the editor of <I>The Times</I>.

Most close observers discounted the possibility and subsequent events
made the theory unlikely.

<P>
Rumors started to swirl as to the real cause of Kasparov's unusual match
tactics.

Some other theories were that the players:-
<UL>
<LI>were expecting the match to be interrupted for the Chess Olympiad;
<LI>were protesting against the proposed two year title cycle, to
    which the Soviet Chess Federation was opposed;
<LI>were relaxing after the struggles during the first nine games
</UL>

<P>
Writing in the March 1985 issue of <I>Chess Life</I>, Soviet emigree and
U.S. chess champion Lev Alburt advanced the theory that Karpov was taking
stimulants during the match.

This hypothesis was Alburt's explanation for Karpov's collapse during the
<A HREF="7375$cix.htm">1974</A> and <A HREF="7678$wix.htm">1978</A>
matches against Korchnoi.

Alburt's theory centered on Dr. Vladimir Zukhar's role during the 1978
match as 'a leading Soviet expert on drugs', not a parapsychologist
as had been reported in the Western press.

<P>
According to Alburt, Zukhar was working with Kasparov's team in
Moscow, so Kasparov knew 'that Karpov has been conditioned for a short
match, a <I>Blitzkrieg</I>' and 'that Karpov will collapse if the
match lasts long enough -- regardless of the length of the games'.

<P>
If this theory were true, why did Karpov accept the short draws and not
try harder to win, perhaps at the cost of losing a game or two?

Surely, each extra day of the match would bring Karpov closer to collapse.

A theory advanced by Kasparov was that Karpov wanted to win 6-0, as
Fischer had done in his <A HREF="7072$cix.htm">1971 candidates
matches</A>.

This would have removed permanently the stigma of having gained the
title by forfeit from Fischer.

<P>
Alburt also claimed that demands for Kasparov to resign the match to allow
Karpov to play in the Olympiad were an attempt to end the match before
Karpov's collapse.

Suggestions to adjourn the match for the Olympiad were similarly
motivated.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 13 - English Opening</B></CENTER>

<P>
The opening followed game 11 until Karpov varied with 6.Nc3.

Karpov sacrificed the exchange, which Kasparov returned immediately.

Kasparov made his first real attempt since game 6 to play with the

In a difficult position, Karpov blundered and allowed Kasparov a strong

By this time most journalists had left Moscow to cover the Olympiad in

There was some concern that the Soviet team was playing without their

This seemed to matter no longer when the Soviets beat the Hungarian

The Hungarians had been one of the principal gold medal contenders

the last full point needed to win the match.

starting with a score of 0-0.

Campomanes then left for Dubai, leaving Alfred Kinzel, former president of
the West German chess federation and serving during the match as chairman
of the appeals committee, in charge of negotiations.

<P>
Kasparov refused the proposal because the arithmetic was against him.

Karpov would need only one win and could afford to take chances, while Kasparov
would need four wins in the eight games.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 48 - Petroff's Defense</B></CENTER>

<P>
The 48th game was played on 8 February.

The opening followed game 28 until Karpov varied on his 7th move.

Kasparov again played aggressively and converted a K-side attack into an
extra pawn.

<P>
The game was adjourned in a R+P endgame.

Kasparov won a second pawn during the resumption and Karpov resigned
after 67 moves.

Karpov still led 5-3, but had suffered two consecutive losses.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">
The match is terminated
</FONT></H3>

<P>
The day that Kasparov won the 48th game, Campomanes, along with R.Keene and other
chess officials was visiting Dubai.

He received a call from Gligoric that Karpov was unable to continue the
match.

<P>
The match was interrupted by timeouts, the first on 11 February,
requested by Kasparov, and then on 13 February, called by Campomanes, who had
returned to Moscow on the 11th.

The Soviet chess federation, in a letter signed by V.Sevastianov,
president of the federation, had demanded a three month suspension of
the match, citing concerns about the health of the players.

This was Campomanes's reason for granting the second timeout.

<P>
Campomanes and Gligoric visited Kasparov on the 14th to discuss Sevastianov's
letter.

Kasparov's response was that either Karpov should abandon the match or the match
should continue.

Mamedov was informed the same evening that the match was to be
stopped.

The announcement would be made at a press conference on the following
day, 15 February.

<P>
Although neither player was expected to attend the press conference,
Kasparov arrived just before it started and sat with the assembled
journalists.

<P>
Campomanes started with a prepared statement.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I declare that the match is ended without decision. There will be a
new match which will start from scratch - the score at 0-0 - on 1
September 1985.

<P>
The two players consent. The next FIDE Congress in August shall
determine further necessary match provisions. The winner of that match
will be the world champion for the period 1985-1986.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The five month long battle on the chess board had failed to determine
the rightful owner of the World Chess Championship title.

<P>
There were some questions from journalists during which Campomanes stated
that he had been with Karpov just before the conference and that Karpov wanted
to continue the match on Monday, the next scheduled playing day.

Campomanes further stated that Kasparov was also not happy with the decision to
stop the match.

<P>
Karpov arrived during the Q&A session, sat down next to Campomanes, and
confirmed that he preferred to continue the match immediately.

Kasparov was invited to speak and asked Campomanes why he was stopping the match
if both players preferred to continue.

<P>
Campomanes replied that he would take advantage of having both players
in the same room to hold a private conversation with both of them at
the same time.

Kasparov declared immediately that he would prefer to continue. Karpov
declared that he was also ready to play on Monday

<P>
The principles, less Kasparov, retired to another room to discuss the
continuation. Kasparov changed his mind and joined them afterwards.

The participants prepared an agreement that the match would be
interrupted. Karpov signed, but Kasparov refused to sign.

<P>
When the press conference continued, Campomanes announced that Karpov accepted
the decision to stop the match and that Kasparov submitted to the decision.

After the new match, Karpov would also be granted the right to a return
match.

The FIDE rules in effect until 1963 were being used again.

<P>
It is a fact that Karpov lost 10 kilos (22 pounds) during the match.

It is an opinion that he lost the respect of much of the chess world.

Campomanes won an enemy in Kasparov, and this would haunt him for years to come.

<P>
If there was a hero in this tale, it was Kasparov.

Trailing by 5-0 after 27 games, he played another 21 games without
a single loss, and thereby avoided losing the match.

Under intense pressure to resign the match, he resisted.

When faced with a premature termination of the match, he refused any
concessions to the Soviet chess authorities, to Campomanes and FIDE, and to
his opponent.

<P>
The mainstream Western press was astonished that a Soviet citizen
could express himself so publicly without retribution from the Soviet
authorities.

<P>
The post-match politics began immediately after the match ended.

The first problem centered on the Chess Oscar for 1984.

<P>
Which was more important -- that Karpov led the match 5-1 at yearend or
that the match was later undecided?

Kasparov's impressive win over Smyslov in the
<A HREF="8284$cix.htm">final candidates match</A>
had also to be taken into account.

<P>
An Oscar for Kasparov would be a blow to Campomanes.

FIDE decided to allow votes by journalists from small federations.

It was the only time that the small federations bothered to vote.

<P>
The envelope was to be opened 24 April in Barcelona.

Campomanes and Karpov were in the city three days before the ceremony.

Karpov won by 1390 votes to 1360 for Kasparov.

The award ceremony was broadcast on Soviet television, which had never
been done before.

<P>
As for the prize fund, it was split evenly between the two players.
