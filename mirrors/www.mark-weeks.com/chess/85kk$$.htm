<BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">
Was there a reigning world champion?
</FONT></H3>

<P>
After the
<A HREF="84kk$$.htm">first Karpov-Kasparov match</A>
was aborted by Campomanes, the question arose whether Karpov should be
considered the reigning champion.

Kasparov considered that Karpov no longer held the title, similar to the
situation in 1946-48 after the death of Alekhine.

<P>
In past title matches over a fixed number of games, the reigning
champion had enjoyed various advantages.

In case of a tied match, the titleholder had always kept the title.

In title matches played before 1963, the titleholder had also enjoyed
a rematch clause, where a second match would be played if the
challenger won the first match.

<P>
What would be done if the second match ended in a tie?

Kasparov suggested that six additional games be played. If still tied, Karpov
would become the world champion.

<P>
Similar considerations arose for a return match.

If Karpov was not the reigning champion, any discussion of a return match
would not be necessary.

<P>
In July 1985, the FIDE Executive council, meeting in Tunisia, decided
that:-
<UL>
<LI>there would be a 24 game match.
<LI>if the match ended 12-12, Karpov would keep the title.
<LI>if Karpov lost, a return match would be granted, but this would be for
    the current cycle only and would not apply to future cycles. This
    meant that Kasparov would have to beat Karpov in one match and then hold him
    to at least a draw in a second. If he succeeded, he would not have
    the advantage of a return match in defending the world
    championship title.
<LI>the loser of the return match would be seeded directly into a
    candidates final match for the current cycle. The match would
    consist of 24 games against the winner of the semifinal match.
    This meant that a new world champion challenger would have to beat
    both Karpov and Kasparov to gain the title.
</UL>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">
Disputes about the match officials
</FONT></H3>

<P>
The question arose as to which officials should serve as chief match
arbiter and as chairman of the appeals committee.

Kasparov was opposed to both Gligoric and Kinzel, whom he suspected of
complicity with Karpov in agreeing to terminate the first match.

L.Schmid was the only name on both Karpov's and Kasparov's list of acceptable
arbiters.

<P>
In June, Campomanes announced that Gligoric would serve as chief match
arbiter and Kinzel as chairman of the appeals committee.

On 25 July, Gligoric announced that he was withdrawing his name.

On 6 August, FIDE nevertheless declared officially that he would serve
in the position.

Two weeks later FIDE declared that L.Schmid was named to the
position, but he had to decline because of other responsibilities.

<P>
FIDE later named A.Malchev of Bulgaria and V.Mikenas as co-arbiters,
to serve on alternating games.

A.Kinzel was named chairman of the match appeals committee.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">
Kasparov fights on and off the board
</FONT></H3>

<P>
To keep his name before the public and to avoid any censorship by the
Soviet authorities, Kasparov decided to play matches against R.Huebner in
West Germany and U.Andersson in Yugoslavia.

He selected the sites based on Kinzel's and Gligoric's nationalities.

<P>
In June, Kasparov played Huebner in Hamburg and won +3-0=3.

The match was sponsored by <I>Der Spiegel</I>, to whom Kasparov granted an
interview.

He claimed that he was afraid that Campomanes, Karpov, and the leading
officials of the Soviet Chess Federation were conspiring to halt the
second match before it was played.

<P>
In July, Kasparov played Andersson in Belgrade and won +2-0=4.

During the match <I>Politika</I> published his letter concerning his
dispute with Gligoric.

<P>
In August, Kasparov was forbidden by the Soviet Federation to grant
interviews to the foreign press.

Kasparov's fear that the match would be cancelled was not realized.

<P>
During the match there was some harassment of Kasparov's supporters.

A.Adorjan, a Hungarian GM who was to assist Kasparov, was denied an entry visa.

R.Knezevic, Yugoslav photojournalist for Tanjug, the official Yugoslav
news agency, was arrested while taking photos and was later expelled
from the Soviet Union.

In June, he had published an interview with Kasparov, who had criticized Karpov
and Gligoric.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">
The match begins
</FONT></H3>

<P>
The match took place in Moscow's Tchaikovsky concert hall, site of
several WCC matches during the 1950s.

Before the match last minute bids were received from Marseille and
London.

Karpov's choice was Moscow.

Kasparov preferred not to play in Moscow and suggested Leningrad.

Backed by the Soviet Chess Federation, FIDE selected Moscow.

<P>
At the time of the match, Karpov was 34 years old and rated 2720. Kasparov was
22 years old and rated 2700.

<P>
Karpov's seconds were GM S.Makarichev and I.Zaitsev.

E.Geller and E.Vasiukov also assisted.

<P>
Kasparov replaced GM G.Timoshenko by GM J.Dorfman as his official second.

Nikitin stayed.

Timoshenko remained as an assistant with IM E.Vladimirov.

Y.Razuvaev served as the chief of his delegation.

<P>
The opening ceremony was held on 2 September.

Kasparov had White in the first game which was played on 3 September.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 1 - Nimzo Indian Defense</B></CENTER>

<P>
Kasparov's choice of opening, which had not been seen in the first match,
seemed to surprise Karpov, who started spending time on his 4th move.

After 15 moves, Kasparov already had a better game.

Kasparov slipped on his 20th move, but Karpov failed to take advantage of it.

Karpov's 22...d5 allowed Kasparov to win a pawn, which proved decisive.

Kasparov sealed his 42nd move, but Karpov resigned before the second session.

Counting the last two games of previous match, this was Karpov's third
consecutive loss, which had never happened to him before.

<P>
It was the first time that Karpov trailed in a match since the 1974
candidates semifinal match against Spassky.

It was also the first time that Kasparov held the lead in the two title
matches.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 2 - Sicilian Defense</B></CENTER>

<P>
In Karpov's first game of the match with White, the players followed game
45 of the previous match. Kasparov varied on his 13th move.

<P>
On his 21st move, Kasparov gave up two bishops in exchange for rook and
pawn.

Around move 30, he won another pawn, but then missed a win a few moves
later.

<P>
Kasparov sealed his 41st move, overlooking the strongest continuation.

Karpov regained a pawn at the start of the second session and the game
became a B+N+Pfgh vs. R+Pafgh endgame.

Kasparov missed the best continuation on his 52nd move and the game was drawn
on the 65th move.

<P>
Karpov took a timeout for game 3.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 3 - Queen's Gambit Declined</B></CENTER>

<P>
The game followed game 27 of the previous match, where Karpov played
White.

Kasparov varied from Karpov's continuation with his 7th move.

After Karpov gained a slight advantage, Kasparov forced a simplification.

The game was drawn after 20 moves, at Kasparov's proposal.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 4 - Queen's Gambit Declined</B></CENTER>

<P>
The opening again followed game 27 of the first match, which Karpov had
won.

Kasparov varied with his 8th move.

Kasparov played aggressively and weakened his K-side against a possible
queen and bishop attack on the b1-h7 diagonal.

<P>
By the time the game was adjourned in Q+R+B+5P opposite color bishop
endgame, Karpov had all of the winning chances, although many observers
considered that Kasparov could hold the draw.

<P>
When the first time control was reached, Karpov sealed, but Kasparov resigned
before resumption in a technically lost endgame.

Karpov now led 3-2.

Kasparov would need to win two more games than Karpov to win the match and the
title.

<P>
After losing two consecutive games, Kasparov took a timeout before game 6.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 6 - Queen's Gambit Declined</B></CENTER>

<P>
The players repeated the opening of game 4, until Karpov varied with his
8th move.

Kasparov sacrificed a pawn on his 16th move, getting an active rook in a R+N
endgame as compensation.

Karpov, unable to free his position, accepted a draw offer on his 28th
move.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 7 - Nimzo Indian Defense</B></CENTER>

<P>
Kasparov repeated the opening from game 1, but Karpov was now prepared for it
and played a different variation on his 4th move.

Kasparov sacrificed his g-pawn on his 11th move, which Karpov declined.

Kasparov offered another pawn on his 19th move, which was accepted, and
obtained open lines against Black's exposed king.

Karpov defended by further opening his king position.

<P>
In time trouble, Karpov missed the strongest continuation on his 27th
move.

A few moves later, Kasparov sacrificed the exchange to achieve a perpetual
check, and the game was agreed drawn.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 8 - Queen's Gambit Declined</B></CENTER>

<P>
The players repeated an opening which had been seen 10 times during
the first match, with Karpov playing White four times.

All of the ten games had ended as draws.

Karpov tried a new idea on his 16th move and gained a small advantage, but
Kasparov sacrificed a pawn to obtain counterplay.

The players followed game 5 until Karpov varied with his 12th move.

With all the pieces on the board, the players maneuvered until move
31, when Kasparov suddenly opened the game and exchanged off all rooks.

<P>
There was some last minute jostling to see who would seal, and the
task fell to Karpov.

Kasparov seemed to have the worse of it, but he found some surprising
resources and the game was drawn on the 53rd move in a Q+B+P vs. Q+4P
endgame

<P><CENTER><B>Game 10 - Sicilian Defense</B></CENTER>

<P>
The players repeated the opening from game 2.

Karpov was the first to vary with 12.Bg1.

perpetual check.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 11 - Nimzo Indian Defense</B></CENTER>

Karpov achieved equality and the game was drawn after 24 moves in an

<P>
Karpov played 1.e4, changed variations to avoid Kasparov's game 12 novelty,
and then produced a novelty of his own on the 6th move.

Kasparov equalized and then played an unusual maneuver to activate his
queen.

The game was agreed drawn after 32 moves in the face of an opposite
color bishop endgame.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 15 - Petrov's Defense</B></CENTER>

<P>
Karpov defended against 1.e4 by returning to the opening seen in the last
game of the first match and varying with his 7th move.

Some subtle opening play by both players produced an even position
which was drawn after 22 moves.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 16 - Sicilian Defense</B></CENTER>

<P>
Both players steered into a repeat of Kasparov's game 12 novelty, so that
the move would get its first real test.

Kasparov avoided variations which recovered the sacrificed d-pawn and on his
16th move took control of the position with a knight on d3.

It was a 'giant lobster' said one GM, referring to the piece's control
over squares on White's back rank; 'an octopus' said another,
referring to its control over a huge section of the board.

<P>
Karpov missed the chance to free his game with 17.d6.

Kasparov played another stunning move with the following.

Kasparov continued to increase his advantage in space until Karpov was forced to
resign on his 40th move.

The game was probably the most crucial of the match as it demonstrated
the heights that Kasparov could reach.

<I>Chess Informant</I> readers selected this game as the best game of

<P>
The opening repeated the 13th game.

In response to a Karpov novelty on the 9th move, Kasparov ruined his pawn
structure by accepting triple isolated pawns.

Both players continued nervously until the game was drawn on the 29th
move.

<P>
Kasparov took a timeout before game 18.

The players repeated the 2nd game until Karpov varied on his 14th move

Karpov played aggressively, but then seemed to have second thoughts when
he offered a draw on the 23rd move, which was accepted.

It was the first game of the current match agreed drawn with most of
the pieces still on the board.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 19 - Nimzo Indian Defense</B></CENTER>

<P>

Karpov declined, but handled the continuation unconvincingly.

Kasparov had an advantage by move 20, but then began to play unconvincingly,
letting part of his advantage slip.

Around move 30, the game entered a phase of mutual time pressure.

Kasparov's nerves proved stronger and Karpov blundered on his 39th move in a
difficult position.

He resigned just after the time control was reached, when Kasparov played
his sealed move on the board.

<P>
Kasparov had scored +3-0=3 in the Nimzo Indian.

With the score 10.5-8.5 in his favor with five games to play, Kasparov's
chance of becoming world champion seemed almost certain.

Karpov's best chance now was to win one game before the 24th game where he
would have White.

A win in the last game would then be enough to retain the title.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 20 - Queen's Gambit Declined</B></CENTER>

<P>
For the first time in either match, Karpov played the Exchange Variation.

Karpov gained a microscopic advantage and held it until adjournment.

Kasparov sealed his 41st move, but showed his disdain for Karpov's winning
attempts by playing his move on the board, as he had done in the
previous game.

<P>
The game settled into a B+P endgame, where Karpov attempted to win through
83 moves.

The game was finally agreed drawn when it became impossible to avoid a
an endgame of lone king vs. bishop and h-pawn with a bishop of the
wrong color.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 21 - Queen's Gambit Declined</B></CENTER>

<P>
Now it was Kasparov's turn to play the Exchange variation.

Karpov played an interesting novelty on his 9th move, but continued
hesitantly and Kasparov obtained an edge by leaving his king in the center.

<P>
Just before the time control, Kasparov overlooked the best continuation with
40.Ke3.

On resumption, the game was drawn after a few moves, although many
observers considered that Kasparov still had winning chances.

Kasparov justified his decision by saying that at the board he noticed an
error that had been made during adjournment analysis and lost faith in
the analysis.

<P>
Down two points with three games to go, Karpov needed a win in the next
game to have any hope of drawing the match.

He took a timeout.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 22 - Queen's Gambit Declined</B></CENTER>

<P>
The players followed game 20, until Karpov varied on his 6th move

Kasparov gave the game a double-edged character by capturing 'away from the
center' on his 11th move.

Karpov played solidly, advanced his kingside pawns against Kasparov's castled
king, exchanged queens, and brought up his king to support the pawns.

<P><CENTER><B>Game 24 - Sicilian Defense</B></CENTER>

<P>
The players followed the same opening which had been played in the
2nd, 10th, and 18th games.

Karpov deviated from the 18th game with 15.g4, launching a typical
Sicilian attack against Kasparov's king.

Kasparov sacrificed his b-pawn on the 26th move and then his g-pawn on his
31st move to obtain an advantage in a complicated position.

Karpov blundered on his 36th move, lost a piece, and resigned a few moves
later.

<P>
On 9 November, having won the match by a score of 13-11, Kasparov became the
13th world champion.
