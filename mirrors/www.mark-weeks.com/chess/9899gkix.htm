<BLOCKQUOTE>
From the Steinitz-Zukertort match in 1886, right up to the death of
Alekhine in 1946, everything was simple. The chess world was similar
to a feudal society, headed by the king (the champion) and the
powerful feudal lords (the grandmasters), with whom the king reached
agreements on the laws of the chess state, which reduced essentially
to one -- how to conduct matches for the World Championship. -

Kasparov seeks a title match
</FONT></H3>

<P>
While many consider that the world chess championship title and the
world's number one chess ranking are the same thing, this is not an
opinion shared by all.

During the months following the <A HREF="9798$wix.htm">FIDE title
match</A> in Lausanne, Kasparov's own PCA title began to lose its
luster.

He had not defended it since the <A HREF="9496pwix.htm">1995 PCA
match</A> with Anand, and there were no plans to do so in 1998.

Although the PCA had never been declared dead, most observers assumed
that nothing more would be heard from it.

<P>
After the <A HREF="9798$cix.htm">FIDE tournament</A> in Groningen,
several super grandmaster tournaments took place.

In January 1998, Kramnik (ELO 2790 at the time of the tournament) and
Anand (2770) tied for first place with 8.5 points in the 14 player,
category 17 tournament held at Wijk aan Zee in the Netherlands.

Shirov (2710), Timman (2635), and Adams (2670) finished a point behind.

Karpov (2735) finished tied with four other players at 6.5 points.

<P>
A story made the rounds during the tournament that Kasparov intended
to organize a match between Kramnik and Anand.

The winner would then play a match with Kasparov.

When Anand was asked whether he had discussed such an arrangement with
Kasparov, he replied that he had had no concrete discussions with
Kasparov and that his contract for the FIDE world championship
prevented him from playing in any such non-FIDE match for one year.

<P>
During February and March, seven of the world's best players met at
the traditional Linares tournament in Spain.

The town of 60.000 inhabitants had for years been the site of the
one of the strongest tournaments in the world.

Anand won the double round robin with 7.5 points, followed by Shirov
with 7, while Kasparov (2825) tied with Kramnik at 6.5.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">
The World Chess Council
</FONT></H3>

<P>
During the opening ceremony at Linares, organizer Luis Rentero and
Kasparov announced the creation of the World Chess Council (WCC).

The two men proposed to sponsor a 10 game match between Kramnik and
Anand in Cazorla, Spain, beginning on 20 May.

<P>
The winner of the Cazorla match would meet Kasparov in October for an
18 game match played in Seville and Linares, with Kasparov to retain
his title if tied.

The prize fund for the match with Kasparov would be 200.000.000 PST
(1.300.000 US$), which was guaranteed by the Andalusian regional
government, according to Rentero, who had procured the funding.

<P>
The WCC -- following the Grandmasters Association (GMA), the European
Chess Union (ECU) and the Professional Chess Association (PCA) --
marked Kasparov's fourth attempt to create a counterbalance to FIDE.

In addition to Rentero and Kasparov, William Wirth of Switzerland
would serve as the vice president of the WCC.

<P>
Regarding the contract with FIDE which prevented Anand from playing
for world championships titles of other organizations, the WCC
suggested that the relevant clause had little weight and could be
settled favorably in court if FIDE took legal action.

Anand's reaction was "I have signed a contract with FIDE, my signature
binds me, and I am a man of my word".

<P>
When it became clear that Anand would not accept to play for the WCC,
his place was offered to Shirov.

The justification was Shirov's excellent showing in the Linares
tournament, where he was in the running for first place until the last
round.

The fact that Shirov had recently taken Spanish citizenship may have
also had some importance in the eyes of the Spanish sponsors.

<P>
Shirov had been eliminated by Anand in the quarterfinal round at
Groningen -- Kramnik had declined to participate at Groningen in
protest against the advantages given to Karpov.

On his way to sharing first place with Svidler and Kramnik at Tilburg
in November 1997, Kasparov had passed judgement on Shirov as a
'talented amateur'.

<P>
At the end of the Linares tournament, Rentero and Wirth confirmed that
Kramnik and Shirov would play the preliminary match.

The loser would receive 100.000 US$, while the winner would go on to
face Kasparov.

The prize fund for the match was also guaranteed by the regional
government of Andalusia.

<P>
Asked about the WCC, Karpov pointed out that Kasparov had become world
champion through FIDE and that it was no through fault of FIDE that he
had refused to defend his title within FIDE's regulations.

Karpov compared Kasparov to Fischer, in that Fischer had refused to
defend his title and had lost it.

More importantly, the FIDE world champion title was the only chess
title recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

<P>
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, concerned by the split in world
chess, offered to negotiate a compromise between FIDE and the WCC.

Kasparov and Rentero did not refuse the offer outright, but did
nothing to pursue it.

<P>
Karpov considered it unwise that anyone should depend on the good will
of Kasparov, rather than on an agreed qualification cycle.

As for himself, he would have no problem playing Kasparov again,
provided that the terms were arranged by a neutral organization using
transparent rules.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">
Shirov beats Kramnik
</FONT></H3>

<P>
Kramnik and Shirov shared first place at the 7th Melody Amber
Tournament held in Monaco in March.

The 12 player, category 18 tournament was a double round robin, where
the players contested a rapid game followed by a blindfold game
against the same opponent, both games played on the same day.

The winners finished with 15 points, closely followed by Ivanchuk with
14.5.

They were trailed by Anand with 12, then Karpov and Topalov (2740)
with 11.5.

<P>
In May, Anand won a 10 player, category 17 tournament in Madrid with
6.5 points, one point ahead of Svidler (2690).

Anand was the only participant with an ELO above 2700, and had been a
strong favorite to win.

<P>
The Shirov-Kramnik WCC match was played from 24 May to 5 June, in
Cazorla, a resort town south of Linares in the region of Andalusia.

Kramnik, 22 years old at the time of the match, had often been ranked
number 2 in the world and had once overtaken Kasparov for the number 1
ranking.

He had been a student of Kasparov and had served as one of Kasparov's
seconds during the <A HREF="9496pwix.htm">1995 PCA match</A> with
Anand.

Shirov, Latvian by birth, was 25 years old and a resident of Spain.

Assisted by Valery Salov, he had trained for two months combining
chess and sport eight hours a day.

<P>
The two players had opposing styles.

Kramnik was known for a conservative, risk avoiding style of play, while
Shirov was an artist constantly in search of beauty.

<P>
The match terms were two games on consecutive days followed by a rest
day.

If the best of 10 match were drawn, there would be a series of
rapidplay games to determine the winner.

Shirov scored +2-0=7 to win 5.5-3.5.

<P>
Shirov won the right to play Kasparov for a prize fund of 1.900.000
US$ (295.000.000 PST), with 65% to the winner.

The match would start 16 October in Seville.

Kramnik received 200.000 US$ (31.000.000 PST).

<P>
Shortly after the WCC match, Kasparov, who had celebrated his 35th
birthday in April, played a new kind of chess match with Veselin
Topalov in Leon, Spain.

The match was played under rules which allowed the players to use
computers equipped with a chess database (ChessBase 7.0) and an
analysis program (Fritz 5), complete with opening and endgame
databases.

This form of chess, dubbed 'Advanced Chess', had been an idea of
Kasparov which he promoted as the 'Chess of the Future'.

<P>
The time control was one hour per player for the entire game.

After the match ended in a 3-3 tie (+2-2=2), there was an improvised
series of playoff games.

There were first two five minute games where Black won both games.

Then there was a sudden death match with White having four minutes and
Black five.

After the first game was drawn, Kasparov won the second game to end
the match.

The two players had played a match of 25 minutes per game at the
beginning of May, which Kasparov had won 4-0.

<P>
At the beginning of July, Kramnik tied for first place with Adams and
Svidler in a 10 player, category 18 tournament held at Dortmund,
Germany.

The three players finished with 6 points.

Anand, who lost one game and drew the rest, tied for 6th-8th.

Shirov finished last with four losses and no wins, the worst result of
his career.

<P>
The mid-1998 FIDE rating list had Kasparov at number 1 with 2815,
followed by Anand (2795), Kramnik (2780), Ivanchuk (2730), Karpov
(2725), and Shirov (2720).

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">
The WCC loses its sponsors
</FONT></H3>

<P>
Billed as a warmup for his forthcoming WCC title match, Kasparov
played a friendly six game match against Jan Timman in Prague, Czech
Republic, starting 6 September.

The match was sponsored by EuroTel, Siemens, and a host of Czech
companies.

The total prize fund for the match was 100.000 US$ with 65% and the
EuroTel trophy to the winner.

Kasparov was heavily favored to win the match as his career record
against Timman was +18-3=22.

<P>
At the press conference on the eve of the match, Kasparov announced
that his WCC title match with Shirov had been cancelled due to lack of
sponsorship and funding.

The funding had been based on verbal agreements between Rentero and
the Andalusian regional government, with half to come from the
Ministry for Tourism and Sport in Andalusia.

<P>
Rentero was a member of the political party which controlled the
Ministry, but some time after the the WCC announcement in February,
control of the Ministry passed to the opposition party in exchange for
a supporting vote on a key issue in the Andalusian parliament.

The new leadership of the Ministry had no desire to sponsor WCC
activities.

<P>
The situation had been known to the other WCC principles since July,
but subsequent efforts to procure alternate funding had failed.

There was still some hope that sponsorship would be found elsewhere --
Los Angeles and Catalonia were rumored to be two possibilities -- but
this had not been confirmed by the time of the press conference.

<P>
Kasparov's reaction was swift. "My title cannot be taken away by
decree. To be the new world champion, somebody is going to have to sit
down across the table and beat me fair and square. I stand ready,
willing, and able to defend my title again."

His future plans were unknown, as he would be playing neither in the
Olympiad nor in the FIDE Championships at the end of the year.

<P>
Shirov had received no payment for his qualifying match against
Kramnik.

He subsequently announced his decision to play for Spain in the
Olympiad in October.

Half of Kramnik's prize for losing the qualifying match had been held
until the final match took place.

<P>
Kasparov went on to win the EuroTel Match over Timman by a score of
4-2 (+2-0=4).

More significant than the match was the appearance of a new potential
sponsor.

At the very moment when it looked as though Kasparov's title was
trapped in the doldrums, EuroTel was about to put new wind in his
sails.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">
Discovered Czech
</FONT></H3>


<P>
EuroTel Praha was a Czech wireless joint venture owned 51% by SPT
Telecom, the Czech PTT, and 49% by Atlantic West.

SPT Telecom itself was 27% owned by Telsource.

TelSource was owned 51% by KPN, the Dutch PTT, and 49% by Swisscom,
the Swiss PTT.

The chief executive of TelSource was Andre F. Bessel Kok, a Dutch
national better known to the chess world as Bessel Kok.

Kok also served as the deputy general director of SPT Telecom,
although insiders said it was Kok who ran the company.

<P>
As chief executive in the 1980s of the telecommunication company
SWIFT, Kok had sponsored a series of annual tournaments in Brussels,
including a GMA World Cup event.

Later he had gone on to a position with the GMA, but had a falling out
with Kasparov, which effectively put an end to the GMA as a viable
organization.

He served as general manager of Belgacom, the Belgian PTT, until the
end of 1994, when he left the company in a disagreement with the
Belgian government over the terms of Belgacom's forthcoming
privatization.

A few months later he was appointed to the top position at TelSource.

<P>
In October, Kok announced that EuroTel would sponsor a 3.000.000 US$
match between Kasparov and the winner of the FIDE World Championship
in Las Vegas.

The proposal foresaw a match in the second half of 1999, between
Kasparov as the reigning world champion and the FIDE participant as
the challenger.

The prize fund would be divided 2/3 to the winner and 1/3 to the
loser.

<P>
In an interview with John Henderson of <I>The Scotsman</I>, Kasparov
announced that 'the proposal has great merit' and that he was taking
the offer seriously.

Asked about his former problems with Kok and the GMA, he replied,
'That was long ago. Hopefully, we are both wiser now than we were
then.'

<P>
The 33rd Chess Olympiad was held in Elista, Kalmykia, in October.

In the mens competition, Russia and the United States finished 1st &
2nd, followed by the Ukraine and Israel tied for 3rd-4th.

In the womens competition, China finished 1st followed by Russia and
Georgia tied for 2nd-3rd.

<P>
Anand won a 12 player, category 18 tournament held at Dortmund,
Germany, at the end of October.

He finished with 7.5 points, a half point ahead of Leko.

Kramnik, at 6 points, tied for 3rd-5th with Sadler and Zvjaginsev.

<P>
In mid-November, Shirov played a six game match against the number one
Czech player Zbynek Hracek (2615) in Ostrava, Czech Republic.

Shirov needed to win 4-2 to avoid losing rating points, but he did
better than this, winning the match 5-1.

<P>
At the end of November, Kasparov and Kramnik played a two day blitz
match in Moscow, sponsored by the Kosmos Hotel.

The prize fund was 24.000 US$ and the match was drawn.

<P>
At the same time Rentero suffered serious injuries when his car was
hit by a truck in Linares.

He was hospitalized with serious head and chest injuries, and spent
more than three weeks in intensive care.

The accident marked a firm and unfortunate end to the WCC, which was
fast becoming a footnote in chess history.

<P>
In December, FIDE Secretary Emmanuel Omuku verbally rejected Kok's
offer to finance the match between Kasparov and a FIDE champion.

The FIDE championship in Las Vegas had been cancelled, reportedly due
to contract difficulties with Karpov, so the FIDE decision may have
been due more to the lack of a player than to any fundamental
opposition to the idea.

Some observers suspected that the collapse of the Russian economy in
August may have been a factor in FIDE's cancellation of the event.

The cancellation meant that there was little world class chess in
December, as most other events had been pushed off the calendar.

<P>
The January 1999 FIDE rating list had Kasparov as the number 1 player
at 2812, followed by Anand (2784), Kramnik (2751), and Shirov (2726).
Karpov (2710) slipped to ninth place.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#dc6000">
Anand is the man
</FONT></H3>

<P>
Kasparov stopped talking about a match with Shirov and expressed his
desire to play a match with Anand.

In an interview published on his <A
HREF="http://www.clubkasparov.ru/">Web site</A> he was asked, "Under
the aegis of what organization?", and replied, "No organization, I
don't care about the organization! A title match under the same aegis
that covered the match between Capablanca and Alekhin, does anyone
remember under which cover they played? Nobody does, at least it does
not matter now."

He went on to state his view that FIDE had always been subservient to
the wishes of the world champion and of the Soviet Chess Federation.

"The time when FIDE was a union of federations is now over. Today FIDE
is not an organization, but one man, who finances it."

He summarized his position with, "Anand needs to define if he wants to
play a real title match with me or not."

<P>
Kasparov won a 14 player, category 17 tournament in Wijk aan Zee,
Netherlands, in January, where he started with a draw followed by
seven consecutive wins.

His score of 10 points put him one half point ahead of Anand.

The two players drew their individual encounter in 22 moves.

Kramnik was third with 8 points, and Shirov finished in a tie for
4th-7th places, losing his individual game against Kasparov.

"This was by far the best tournament of my life", Kasparov said
afterwards. "I won eight games and I can be proud of each one of
them."

<P>
At the beginning of February, Shirov issued a statement on his views
surrounding the WCC difficulties and Kasparov's subsequent statements.

<SMALL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Since Gary Kasparov has made many statements and given interviews,
press releases etc., I strongly feel that the time has come for me to
end my silence and express my views on what has happened with and
around the WCC World championship.

<P>
[...]

<P>
Back in 1993 the former World champion Mikhail Botvinnik said that
Kasparov would end up as his own owner of the World champion title as
it has been the case with Lasker, Capablanca and Alekhine.

Today we see that the late patriarch was right - Kasparov has just
stated that Anand is the World number two player and should just
challenge him for the title without preliminary competition.

<P>
But has there really been no preliminary competition between 1995 and
1999? I am afraid this is where the main contradiction to Kasparov's
statements lies.

<P>
[...]

<P>
When I won the match [against Kramnik] I immediately realised that
things were shaky and my match vs. Kasparov was up in the air.

However officially it was still announced for October 1998, they were
speculating about both Sevilla and Marbella as the location and
Rentero repeatedly said in telephone conversations that the prize fund
of 2 million dollars for the match was under control.

<P>
The sad truth became apparent in the end of August when Rentero
finally admitted that the signature of Junta Andalucia never existed,
that he had all the copies of the contract and he could just eat them
rather than pay me the 200,000$ compensation for cancellation of the
match as stated in the contract.

<P>
The WCC did not stop functioning however and rather cynically offered
me to play the match in California for the prize fund of 600,000$ with
400,000$ going to the winner and 200,000$ for the loser and Kasparov
accepting that!

Well, 200,000$ guarantee for two matches (I mean that all that I got
in Cazorla were the bills) had not been the case for quite a while in
World Championships and I naturally refused it as I estimated it too
low.

I suggested the prize fund of 1,000,000$ with the distribution
600,000$ to the winner and 400,000$ to the loser instead.

<P>
I should state that the California offer with 600,000$ prize fund was
the only more or less serious offer I've had until now.

Later on Kasparov stated in many interviews that I had turned down the
one million offer because of the different distribution (650 thousand
to the winner and 350 thousand to the loser) and these statements are
completely untrue.

I have never seen the official one million offer and I already had had
enough verbal offers made by Mr. Rentero.

<P>
I have also tried (and even got the verbal promises again!) to raise
the prize money in Catalonia where I live but so far nothing is
confirmed.

Of course, Kasparov's continuous statements that he wants to play
Anand don't improve the situation.

<P>
I presume that my legitimacy as the World Championship contender is
not any lower than Kasparov's legitimacy as the World Champion.

And if we follow the historical line and assume that the World
championship outside FIDE still exists (although in future the
agreement between players and FIDE should be made) then my match
against Kasparov should finally be organized.

I have won all the matches I played since 1991 with a high score, so I
feel ready to beat Kasparov in the match play.

<P>
Alexei Shirov, 4.02.1999

</BLOCKQUOTE>
</SMALL>

<P>
Kasparov responded with his own statement.

<SMALL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
I was ready to play Shirov and I did everything possible to
facilitate that.

However, I did not succeed in either Andalucia or California, who both
potentially provided us with the opportunity of holding this match.

However, my adversary considered the conditions offered to be
insufficient.

Indeed, the prize fund in the case of California just half that of
Andalucia but we ended up in a similar position.

<P>
It is not only Shirov who has suffered.

My material and moral losses can be compared with his.

I spent six months preparing and I would also like to add that in
September, I paid for preliminary work on organizing the match in
California.

This money has been lost.

<P>
The reality is that nobody wants to organize such a match.

Potential sponsors are much more interested in a match between the
number 1 and 2 chess players: Kasparov & Anand.

<P>
Alexei Shirov says that the Spanish province of Catalonia could
organize the match, but as far as I know, the Catalonian Minister for
Sports has only supported the idea of holding the match there and has
not made a single practical move towards organizing it.

Enrico Touret, a businessman from Barcelona, expressed interest but I
have not received any offers from him for four months.

<P>
In order to compensate Shirov for his losses in some way, I have
recently ceded to him the right to play a commercial match with Judith
Polgar in the summer.

The match is organized by Bessel Kok, has a prize fund of 200 thousand
dollars, and will be held in Prague.

<P>
In an interview with <I>Europe Echecs</I>, Kramnik agreed with Shirov
that Kasparov had an obligation to contest the promised match with
Shirov.

A match would also help Kasparov improve his tarnished image with the
chess world.

He declared that, for what little it mattered, Karpov was the official
owner of the world championship title, and attributed Kasparov's fine
playing form, especially in the openings, to his preparations for the
match with Shirov.

He also said his loss to Shirov in the WCC qualifying match was 'an
accident' due to non-chess problems he was having at the time of the
match.

<P>
Wijk aan Zee in January, Linares in February -- a year after the
announcement of the WCC, Kasparov gave one of the most impressive
performances of his career.

He dominated the 8 player, category 20 double round robin tournament,
and scored 10.5, to finish 2.5 points ahead of Anand and Kramnik.

Against Anand, he drew in the first round and won in the second round.

<P>
At the end of the Linares tournament, Kasparov gave a press conference
where he announced that he was withdrawing from an 'Advanced Chess'
match against Anand in Leon, Spain, scheduled for June.

The event had been confirmed in November.

He said, "I want to teach the organisers a lesson on how to treat the
World Champion", and objected to the phrase 'completely unacceptable'
which the Spaniards had used in written correspondence to negotiate
the terms of the match with his business manager.

"I was very hurt by these words."

<P>
The organizers in turn pointed out that the clause they had deemed
unacceptable was, as they phrased it, "if the match does not take
place through the organisers' fault, then they still have to pay a
large honorarium entirely, whereas if the match doesn't take place
through Kasparov's fault then he wouldn't offer any kind of economic
compensation to the organisation, and he would just have to give back
any ADVANCE received. By the way, it was not agreed to advance any
amount."

They also announced that Karpov would replace Kasparov in the match
against Anand.

<P>
A few weeks later, Canadian promoter Serge Grimaux proposed a
different match between Kasparov and Anand.

Grimaux is known for arranging live events, such as pop concerts, in
the Czech Republic.

The Press Release of Serge Grimaux<BR>
GM Garry Kasparov Vs. GM Vishy Anand<BR>
The Ultimate World Chess Championship
</CENTER>

<P>
Following several weeks of discussions which started earlier this year
in Madrid Friday, March 12, during a meeting attended by the current
World Chess Champion and the highest ranked player after him, it is
now official: GM Garry Kasparov has accepted to put at stake the World
Champion title he now holds for more then thirteen years and defend it
against the ever amazing Vishy Anand.

<P>
The detailed offer prepared by Serge Grimaux, a Canadian entrepreneur
in the field of live entertainment for more then twenty years,
currently active in North America as well as in Central Europe, has
received full backing of world known Chess mentors respected by the
entire Chess community and headed by Mr. Bessel Kok, GM Fridrik
Olafson (former FIDE President) and Dr. William Wirth.

<P>
As Mr. Kasparov stated it: "I have always welcomed Championships as
they are the essence of every sport. A World Championship is even more
exciting. Meeting with Vishy will certainly provide the kind of chess
games which will be followed, like never before, throughout the entire
planet.

<P>
The offer will expire this coming Friday, April 23, 1999, at midnight
London time, U.K., but, as stated above, has already received the
acceptance of GM Garry Kasparov. Everyone is now waiting for GM Vishy
Anand to act similarly.

<P>
The host city of the Championship will be decided by a committee of
Chess organizing experts. The Championship is scheduled to commence in
October 1999. The prize fund is comprised of US$3,000,000:
US$2,000,000 for the winner and US$1,000,000 for the other party.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
</SMALL>

<P>
Kasparov immediately accepted the offer, but the deadline passed
without any formal response from Anand.

As the press release came on the heels of the cancellation of the
'Advanced Chess' match with Anand, some observers suspected that
Kasparov's motives for cancelling were not entirely due to a
contractual dispute with the Leon organizers.

<P>
Kramnik won the 8th Melody Amber Tournament held in Monaco in March.

The 12 player, category 18 double round robin tournament followed the
same format as in previous years.

The winner finished with 14.5 points, followed by Topalov (2700) &
Shirov with 14, and Anand with 11.5.

Anand won the rapid game round robin with 7.5, but finished far behind
the three winners of the blindfold round robin.

<P>
In April, Adams (2716) won a 10 player, category 18 tournament at Dos
Hermanas (Seville), Spain with 6.0.

Kramnik was 2nd with 5.5, Karpov tied for 5-6th with 4.5, and Anand
finished tied for 8-10th with 3.5 (+0-2=7).

In an interview with the Indian Express, Anand said that he was not
concerned about his result at Dos Hermanas.

He attributed his poor finish to too much chess during the previous
months.

Asked about the match with Kasparov he said that he was 'still
considering it'.

<P>
In May, Kasparov won a 10 player, category 19 tournament at Sarajevo,
Bosnia, with a score of 7.0 and without losing a single game.

Shirov tied for 2nd-3rd with Bareev (2679) at 6.0.

Kasparov and Shirov drew their individual encounter, after which
Kasparov praised his opponent's resourceful play, although Shirov
declined to conduct a post mortem analysis with Kasparov.

While the tournament was being played, NATO warplanes flew over Bosnia
to attack Serb military positions in the Kosovo conflict.

When asked about Anand's refusal to sign the contract with Grimaux,
Kasparov answered, "What has he been thinking about for eight weeks?
If he prefers to play in Las Vegas, the offer will go to Shirov."

He also mentioned that the contract obligated the winner to defend the
title in 2001 following an eight player candidates tournament.

THE ULTIMATE WORLD CHESS CHAMPIONSHIP<BR>
GM GARRY KASPAROV Vs. GM VISWANATHAN ANAND<BR>
THE MILLENNIUM BATTLE OF THE MINDS<BR>
Prague, Czech Republic, June 6, 1999
</CENTER>

<P>
After several weeks of negotiations Serge Grimaux proudly announced
today that World Champion GM Garry Kasparov and Challenger GM
Viswanathan Anand, #2 World Player and two time Chess Oscar Winner,
both signed a very detailed and professionally prepared contract
whereby the World Champion will defend his title against the
Challenger in a World Championship to be held in the last quarter of
this year.

<P>
Bessel Kok, Chairman of the Organizing Committee further composed of
GM Fridrik Olafsson and Dr. William Wirth stated: "This is the
Championship everybody has been waiting for and which certainly will
be considered as the Millennium Battle of the Minds." Sixteen games
will be played. In case of a draw GM Kasparov will retain his title.
The Prize Fund will be of US$3,000,000 .

<P>
The signatories to the agreement have agreed to an exciting format
where instead of granting the runner-up of the 1999 World Championship
an automatic rematch, there will instead be a new Challenger Cycle in
2000 the winner of which will be nominated the Challenger for the next
World Championship title scheduled for 2001.

<P>
As Serge Grimaux stated: "I would like to thank World Champion, GM
Garry Kasparov as well as GM Viswanathan Anand #2 World Chess Player
and twice Chess Oscar Winner, for having refrain from the right to
request a rematch in case they would lose the Championship, hereby
clearing the way for a financially attractive Challenger Cycle."

<P>
The Ultimate World Chess Championship will be under the supervision of
the Organizing Committee which will meet next this coming July 10,
1999, in Prague, Czech Republic, during the Garry Kasparov EuroTel
Trophy 1999 match, featuring GM Alexei Shirov Vs. GM Judith Polgar,
and will then review the overall status and important elements of the
event.

<P>
Questions shall be directed to: Serge Grimaux

<P>
Serge Grimaux, was the organizer of the very successful EuroTel Chess
Tournament presented in Prague last September where GM Garry Kasparov
defeated GM Jan Timman. From The Rolling Stones to Maestro Luciano
Pavarotti, from David Copperfield to the Alvin Ailey American Dance
Theatre Company, from Miles Davis to Michael Jackson, he has been
involved in live presentations of all sorts for the last twenty five
years, in Canada as well as in several European countries.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
</SMALL>

<P>
At the same time, Anand declined to sign his contract to play at the
FIDE event in Las Vegas, which would have prevented him from playing
any match against Kasparov.

Speculation was that the match would be played in October, would be
held in Prague, New York, or London, and would be sponsored by a major
high tech company.

The 'Challenger Cycle' was reported variously to be 8, 10, 16, and 32
players.

It was understood that details would be announced 10 July during the
EuroTel Trophy match.

<P>
Shirov soon issued his own press release.

<P>
Official Press Release 2

<P>
More than five months have passed since my first press release. It's
definitely not my style to write open letters, however after so much
desinformation around my match against Kasparov (now in fact the match
Kasparov- Anand) I feel that I have to clear some points. Just for
chess' sake.

<P>
Even before my first press release was published, Kasparov had stated
that he wanted to play Anand because 'it was impossible to find money
for the match Shirov-Kasparov' and that 'the match Shirov-Kasparov was
not interesting for sponsors because Anand was much stronger'.
Kasparov repeated these statements until finally on 3rd of June this
year Anand was rumoured (I can't find a better word since the official
announcement is to be made on 10th of July) to sign the contract for
their match.

<P>
Let me refute these statements one by one. First of all, Anand is not
anymore stronger than me. Nor is he in comparison with ,for example,
Kramnik and Morozevich. His last two tournament performances in Monaco
and Dos Hermanas were complete failures as he was behind his main
rivals. And now, after my relative success in Sarajevo my WCC rating
is even higher than Anand's. I don't give much importance to the WCC
rating but it's Kasparov who always considers the WCC rating to be
more objective than the FIDE rating. Complete contradiction. When last
year I collapsed in Dortmund, Kasparov was quick to say that my
performance diminished sponsors' interest for the match. What has
changed until now when Anand shared the last place in Dos Hermanas?
Strange game.

<P>
A few words about Anand's legitimacy. Everybody knows that last year
Anand refused to play the candidate's match vs. Kramnik, let me call
it 'semifinal'. And now when I replaced him in the semifinal and
qualified for the final, he goes to take my place apparently without
any conscience problems! As if believing that it's not his problem
that I don't have sponsors for the match and the people who want to
make Kasparov-Anand match don't recognize my legitimacy.

<P>
And the absence of sponsors is not the true case at all. Now it's 100%
clear to me that if Kasparov had always recognized me as his only
legitimate opponent for the World Championship match, it would have
been possible to make it. And he revealed himself when at the end of
May he publicly stated that if Anand refused then he would play
against me. So, it was definitely not a money problem that Kasparov
preferred to play Anand instead of me. And the real reasons one will
never know. I could only add that in March, during the Linares
tournament Kasparov refused to have a telephone conversation with the
Catalan manager Enric Turet who was working hard trying to make my
match against Kasparov in Barcelona and Terrasa. And shortly after
that (on March 12, I believe) Kasparov accepted the offer of Mr. Serge
Grimaux, the promoter of Kasparov-Anand match, it remained just to
wait for Anand's answer. And since the answer could come at any time,
any organization that was interested in my match against Kasparov
(apart from Mr.Turet I was also contacted by people in Poland, England
and USA) could find it useless to go on working on it.

<P>
My last and real chance to play against Kasparov would have been
Anand's negative responce to Mr. Grimaux's offer. But this was too
much a hope as in our world a lot of people strive for money and more
money, so Anand proved to be no exception by taking what doesn't
belong to him. I consider both Anand and Kasparov guilty for depriving
me of the World Championship match and that this century will end with
their inlegitimate 'World Championship'.

<P>

In June, Anand beat Karpov in the Advanced Chess Match in Leon, Spain,
by a score of 5-1 (+4-0=2).

A few weeks later Kasparov won the 4 player, category 21, quadruple
round robin Siemens Giants rapidplay event, held as part of the
Frankfurt Chess Classic.

His score of 7.5 put him ahead of Anand and Kramnik at 6.0, while
Karpov trailed at 4.5.

Proving his superiority over his rivals, Kasparov won each of his
individual matches with the same score of +1-0=3.

In the same event, the computer program Fritz 6 (unrated) won the 8
player, category 15, double round robin Frankfurt-West Masters with
9.5, ahead of seven strong grandmasters.

Leko (2694) and Topalov (2700) finished 2nd-3rd with 9.0.

The tournament's category would have been higher if Fritz had
carried a rating.

At the end of the same event, Anand played Fritz in a four game match,
winning +1-0=3.

<P>
On 21 June in New York, Kasparov played 1.e4 as the first move of
Kasparov vs. the World.

The event, held on the Microsoft Network (MSN), allowed players all
around the world to vote for the next move to be played against
Kasparov.

The move with the most votes was chosen as the World's move.

The World chose the Sicilian Defence with 1... c5 and the game
continued 2.Nf3 d6 3.Bb5+ Bd7.

The MSN Internet site quickly received 2 million hits, causing
temporary problems, but showing the immense interest in a quality
chess event.

<P>
The July 1999 FIDE rating list had Kasparov (2851) 1st, followed by
Anand (2771), Kramnik (2760), Morozevich (2758), and Shirov (2734).

Karpov (2700) dropped to tenth on the list.

<P>
In July, Leko (2701) won the 8 player, category 19 tournament at Dortmund,
with 5.0.

Kramnik finished 2nd with 4.5, followed by Karpov, Anand, and Adams
(2708) with 4.0.

<P>
At about the same time, Shirov won a six game match (+5-0=1) against
J.Polgar (2671) to win the EuroTel Trophy in Prague.

The trophy was presented to Shirov by Kasparov.

Kok was also present at the match, but made no announcement about the
Kasparov - Anand match.

Most observers suspected that the organizers had not been able to find
a sponsor.

Some speculated that the interest generated by the forthcoming <A
HREF="9899$wix.htm">FIDE World Championship</A> in Las Vegas would
create sponsorship opportunities for the Grimaux event.

</FONT></H3>

<P>
In the quarterfinal round of the Las Vegas knockout tournament, Shirov
was eliminated by L. Nisipeanu and Kramnik was eliminated by Adams. 

The surprise victory of Khalifman reopened the debate on how world
championship chess matches should be conducted. 

Making his own position clear, FIDE President Ilyumzhinov said, 'I
want to congratulate Alexander Khalifman, the 14th World Chess
Champion. I want to invite him to play again next year to defend his
title. From now on, the World Champion must defend his title on the
chessboard, not in press conferences or in the courts.'

<P>
A few weeks after the Las Vegas tournament ended, Kuruvilla Abraham,
Anand's manager, announced that the Kasparov - Anand match would not
be held in 1999.

<SMALL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Text of Mr. Kuruvilla Abraham, manager of GM V.Anand in Chennai sent
out to Indian newspapers on Tuesday 14th September 1999.

<P>
The much awaited match between Viswanathan Anand and Garry Kasparov
will not happen this year. The 16 game championship, which was to have
taken place in October this year, has been canceled due to lack of
sponsorship. The event was originally to have been sponsored by a
Silicon Valley mega- corporation who pulled out in the last minute due
to a conflict of interest caused by Kasparov's, Microsoft backed,
Internet based chess match.

<P>
As a sequence, the promoter Mr. Serge Grimaux, was unable to finalise
an alternative sponsor within the deadline prescribed by the formal
agreement signed by all parties involved.

<P>
Subsequently, Mr. Grimaux requested and was given 30 further business
days (holidays and weekends not included) to make other sponsorship
arrangements. However, despite his best efforts, adequate sponsorship
commitments were not finalised during this extended period and
therefore the championship now stands canceled.

<P>
Mr. Grimaux is yet to make an official statement about the status of
this championship, which would have been a face off between the two
strongest players of the world. A team of eminent people headed by Mr.
Bessel Kok had informed the committee under whose authority the
championship was supposed to have been organised. The committee may
meet at a later date to decide on a future championship.

<P>
Viswanathan Anand, who had kept away from the FIDE Championship due to
his contractual obligation to this event, stated, "It is sad that the
championship will not happen this year. It would have meant a big
boost for committed commercial sponsorship of chess."

<P>
It is also unfortunate that Garry Kasparov, went ahead with a press
conference in London to announce that the championship was cancelled
before the expiry of the extended organising period given to Mr.
Grimaux by all signatories to the agreement. All the signatories were
bound by a clause of confidentiality, which Mr. Kasparov has not seen
necessary to honour. 

</BLOCKQUOTE>
</SMALL>

<P>
Kasparov's manager responded with his own press release.

<SMALL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
WORLD CHESS CHAMPIONSHIP NOT CANCELLED

<P>
I have read the press release attributed to Mr. Kuruvilla Abraham,
Manager of Vishy Anand, and it contains sufficient inaccuracies to
warrant a response. It also makes a salacious attack upon my client
which needs attention.

<P>
Mr. Abraham commences by saying that the match between Kasparov and
Anand will not take place this year and next says "has been cancelled"
and again in the third paragraph says "now stands cancelled". It is,
therefore, Mr. Abraham who has jumped the gun and made a statement
that should have come from Bessel Kok (Chairman) or Serge Grimaux
(Promoter). What caused Mr. Abraham to rush into print with a
cancelled statement is beyond my comprehension especially as it is my
understanding that his client does not think the match is cancelled.

<P>
Next, Mr. Abraham compounds his errors by making a statement about a
Silicon Valley corporation pulling out at the last minute due to a
conflict of interest caused by the Kasparov-Microsoft match. This is
pure fiction! The potential sponsor knew about the Microsoft match and
I was with Garry when the Chairman of the potential sponsoring company
said that the Microsoft match was not a problem to them.

<P>
Where does Mr. Abraham get this stuff? Perhaps he would be good enough
to tell us?

<P>
Then comes a low blow as Mr. Abraham tries to lay the failure for no
sponsorship on Garry Kasparov. The facts are that the committee took
on the task of finding the site, sponsor and organization about nine
months ago and soon turned the organization and the all important
guarantees over to Mr. Grimaux. Serge Grimaux had his contracts out to
both players well before Garry revealed that he "might" have a total
sponsor for not just one but for many years. We cautioned them against
stopping other sponsorship solicitations. This was done verbally and
in writing.

<P>
If Mr. Abraham cares to check, he will discover that Serge and the
committee went into this agreement a long time ago and at that time,
led us to believe that they had excellent sponsorship prospects. To
try and blame Garry is a very cheap shot indeed!

<P>
Errors are compounded in the last paragraph which reads "It is also
unfortunate that Garry Kasparov went ahead with a press conference in
London to announce that the championship was cancelled before the
expiry of the extended organizing period given to Mr. Grimaux by all
signatories to the agreement. All the signatories were bound by a
clause of confidentiality, which Mr. Kasparov has not seen necessary
to honor." The press conference in London was called by Microsoft and
had nothing to do with the World Championship. The only question asked
about the World Championship was whether Microsoft would be the
sponsor? A Microsoft representative answered and not Garry, and a
transcript of the conference is available. So now, we have no
statement by Garry as described by Mr. Abraham. After the conference,
Garry was asked privately about the match and he was very careful with
his answers saying that he could not see the likelihood of the match
taking place this year and what is important, at no stage did Garry
say that the match was cancelled.

<P>
The last sentence of Mr. Abraham's release is insulting and if he is
deliberately trying to kill off a potential match, then insulting
Garry is the best way to set about it. I hope he will apologize.

Serge Grimaux

<P>
After many months of negotiations with several major American
corporations in the field of information technology, which had given
the Committee and the event promoter, Serge Grimaux, strong
indications to support the Ultimate World Chess Championship,
unfortunately no agreement was able to be reached.

<P>
Consequently contractual and logistic deadlines cannot be met and the
Committee will review with the players a possible date for the event
in the early part of 2000.

<P>
In the meantime a major European city has offered to host the match,
providing all the necessary infrastructure in terms of logistic and
venue.

<P>
Negotiations are currently taking place with alternative sponsors.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
</SMALL>

<P>
No sponsor was found.

Anand later identified EuroTel as the company which paid him for the
aborted match.

The amount of 200.000 US$ was disclosed by other sources.

<P>
A few weeks after the Grimaux announcement, the World resigned its
game against Kasparov.

Although the end of the game was marred by accusations of ballot
stuffing and technical difficulties in posting the coaches'
recommendations, the event was a great success.

It showed that the Internet was a viable medium for promoting interest
in chess.

Kasparov said, "It was an incredible game, such a mixture of pleasure
and irritation. This game consumed much time and energy, but it was an
amazing fight".

Interest continued after the game when Kasparov tried to prove that he
had a win in a controversial position, while other strong players
tried to refute his analysis.

<P>
The weeks around the year 2000 changeover saw a curious exchange
between Feng-hsiung Hsu, the principal designer of IBM's Deep Blue
chess computer, and Owen Williams, Kasparov's agent.

In an open letter, Feng-hsiung Hsu offered the third match that
Kasparov had been seeking since the disastrous
<A HREF="9697imix.htm">1997 match with Deep Blue</A>.

For reasons which are not completely clear from the correspondence,
Kasparov declined.
