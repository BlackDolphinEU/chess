<p><strong>Press Release</strong></p>

<p><em>Lausanne, 18 May 1998</em></p>

<p>The FIDE Executive Council, at its meeting which ended over
the weekend in Bled, Slovenia, unanimously approved the staging
of the World Chess Championship finals in December 1998 in Las
Vegas with a prize fund of US$3,000,000.</p>

<p>This unanimous resolution, which is coming ahead of the 1998
FIDE Congress in Elista, represents a further endorsement of the
decision of the FIDE President, His Excellency Kirsan
Ilyumzhinov, to change the two year cycle to an annual event.
President Ilyumzhinov, who chaired the meeting, said that his
action was motivated by the need to seize the initiative arising
from the success of the last Championship, which was held under
the patronage of the International Olympic Committee.</p>

<p>The Council applauded the decision to increase the prize fund
from US$5,000,000 to US$6,000,000 over two years and noted that
the FIDE rules and regulations, which were subscribed to by all
the players in the last World Championship, provided an adequate
legal framework for the change.</p>

<p>The Executive Council directed the World Championship Cycle
Committee to finalize the regulations and player's contract
setting the deadline for the submission of the player's contract
for the 1<sup>st</sup> of November 1998. It reemphasized the
decision of the General Assembly last year in Kishinev not to
grant any special privileges to the top players in order not to
give them an unfair sporting advantage over other participants.</p>

<p>The Council also approved the increase in the number of zonal
qualifiers noting that this would encourage the top players to
participate in their respective national championships and zonal
events. Grandmasters Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik would be
invited to participate in the Las Vegas event.</p>

<p>On the current cycle of the Women's World Championship, the
Executive Council directed that the candidates and finals of the
Championships should be concluded in accordance with previously
announced dates in 1998, as the next cycle under the knock-out
format is scheduled to commence in 1999.</p>

<p>The Council formally conferred the title of Grandmaster on
Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine who last year at the age of 14
became the youngest ever Grandmaster in the history of chess.</p>

<p><big><strong>Message of the President</strong></big></p>

<p>Dear Chess Friends,<br>
<br>
On the 26th of September, I shall be on hand to welcome to Elista, members of delegation
from the over 120 countries, who have honoured our invitation, to participate in the 33rd
Chess Olympiad and 69th FIDE Congress. The recent brief from the Executive Council of the
Olympiad, on on-going preparations, leave me in no doubt that we shall celebrate this
Olympiad in the true spirit of FIDE's motto. Let me therefore, in my dual capacity as FIDE
President and President of the Kalmyk Republic, take this early opportunity to thank all
those who in many ways, have consistently reposed their confidence in us, despite the
unfortunate events of the past few months. Time will surely vindicate us all.<br>
<br>
The 69th FIDE Congress, also provides us with a unique opportunity to take some
far-reaching decisions that will set the stage for FIDE's increasing relevance as an
important sports organisation, well into the 21st Century. As you may probably be aware, I
have decided to maintain the same electoral ticket with whom you gave me your mandate to
pilot the affairs of our organisation at the 1996 FIDE Congress in Yerevan. Our experience
in the past 2 years, has shown that FIDE is now in capable hands. Together, we have
successfully charted a new course for our future growth, and I am certain that our ticket
will continue to relentlessly pursue our program with renewed vigour.<br>
<br>
Last week in Moscow, I signed with Messrs Fishman &amp; Associates, the final protocol for
the staging of the World Championships in Las Vegas from 29 November to 27 December 1998,
at a ceremony attended by Ambassador Alexey Orlov, World Championship Cycle Chairman Willy
Iclicki and Executive Director Emmanuel Omuku. In Elista, we shall seek the General
Assembly's ratification, of the unanimous decision of the Executive Council to hold the
World Championship on an annual basis. I am certain that the World Chess Foundation, FIDE
and the US Chess Federation will collaborate successfully with our partners, Fishman &amp;
Associates in what promises to be an exciting event.<br>
<br>
GENS UNA SUMUS</p>

<p><br>
<strong>Kirsan Ilyumzhinov</strong><br>
President<br>
<br>
Moscow, 31 August 1998</p>

<B>FIDE World Championship Tournament Postponed</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
"The World Chess Federation (FIDE), in conjunction with the U.S. Chess
Federation (USCF), has officially announced that it will hold the 1999
World Chess Championship in Las Vegas, Nevada. However, in
latebreaking news released October 10, FIDE had reportedly reached a
compromise with current FIDE World Champion Anatoly Karpov, postponing
the FIDE event until January, thus allowing Karpov to hold his title
for a full year. In exchange, Karpov would agree to play with a
seeding into the second round (rather than the semi-finals.) For
additional details on that announcement, see IA Carol Jarecki's report
from Elista in this week's Chess Buzz. However, since then GM Karpov
has indicated that it is still not "100% certain" that he will play,
and the timing is complex since the Wijk an Zee event would comflict
with a January scheduling. The October 15 FIDE Press conference has
also been postponed. At this point, all one can say for certain is
that there has been an announcement that the event will be postponed
at least one month.

<P>
"This event will bring together about 100 of the world's top players in
a knock-out format to compete for the title. Last year GM Kasparov was
invited, but declined the invitation because he did not like the
knock-out format. He is not expected to participate in the 1999 event,
either. The total prize fund will be about $3 million, with a minimum
prize of $6,000 for those eliminated in the first round, and about
$650,000 to the eventual first-place winner."
