For the first time since 1948, a chess player from outside the Soviet
Union had achieved the right to play a match for the World Chess
Championship title. The opening ceremony in Reykjavik was scheduled
for 1 July 1972, but on that day Robert Fischer was not in Iceland.

<P>
Fischer, who had not signed any document confirming his participation,
was demanding an increase in the 125.000 US$ prize fund, as well as
restrictions on television cameras.

  <B>Will There Be a Match?</B>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
  The match of the century was supposed to have started Sunday, July 2,
  but it did not.  Fischer had failed to show up in Reykjavik after two
  abortive attempts to board Loftleidir flights earlier in the week.
  Both times, press photographers had driven the camera-shy challenger
  back to New York City following brief appearances at Kennedy airport.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
  Then Bobby announced he was holding out for 30% of the gate receipts
  for both himself and Spassky. The Icelanders could not agree, since
  they had earmarked that anticipated income for expenses connected with
  the staging of the match.

  Suddenly, a British chess promoter and financier, James Slater, came
  forward with a dazzling surprise $125,000 donation to the prize fund,
  matching the amount the Icelandic Chess Federation had put up, and
  setting the winner's slice of the purse at $156,250 and the loser's at
  $93,750.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
  But even this record purse did not bring Bobby to Reykjavik, although
  it more than made up for what the share of the admissions would have
  come to. For whatever reason, it took hours of persuasion by Bill
  Lombardy, Fischer's last-minute choice as second, and attorney Paul
  Marshall to get Bobby to go through with the match.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  </SMALL>

<P>
Fischer arrived in Reykjavik on 4 July. He apologized to Spassky, to
Max Euwe, the president of FIDE, and to the organizers for having
missed the opening ceremonies.

<P>
The first game was played on 11 July. Of the five games contested
previously between the two players, the score was three wins for
Spassky and two draws. At the appointed hour, match arbiter Lothar
Schmid started the clock and Spassky played 1.d4, but Fischer was not
in the Laugardalshoell Sports Exhibition Palace.

<P>
Seven long minutes passed and then Fischer arrived. He shook Spassky's
hand and sat down to play. The 'Match of the Century' had finally
begun.

<P>
On the 29th move, in a drawn position, Fischer captured a poison pawn,
allowing his bishop to be trapped. It was a move which almost any
strong player would have rejected instinctively.

<P>
Struggling with pawns against a bishop and pawns, Fischer missed a
draw just before adjournment. During the second session on the
following day, he left the playing area for 30 minutes to protest the
presence of a television camera. After returning, he resigned on the
56th move.

<P>
That evening Fred Cramer, an official of the U.S. Chess Federation and
a spokesman for Fischer, sent a letter to Schmid demanding that the
television cameras be removed and that the spectators not be seated in
the first few rows of the hall. Chester Fox, an American businessman
who had procured filming rights, responded that the cameras were
necessary to finance the match.

<P>
On 13 July, the clock was started for the second game, but Fischer was
not at the board. Fox quickly accepted that the cameras be removed for
at least that game. Fischer agreed to play provided that his clock was
reset to zero. Schmid refused and forfeited the challenger after one
hour.

<P>
Contrary to all expectations, Fischer did not leave Iceland. Was it
the phone call he received from Henry Kissinger, or the many telegrams
from his fans around the world? Whatever the reason, the match
continued on 16 July, in a closed playing area.

<P>
The third game marked the first time that Fischer had ever beaten
Spassky.

During his entire career, Fischer was known for opening exclusively
with 1.e4. Annotating this move in his book
<A HREF="wcc-blio.htm#fis-60mg">My 60 Memorable Games</A>,
he wrote 'Best by test', in the notes for one game, and 'I have never
opened with the QP - on principle.' for another.

<P>
In game 6 Fischer played the Queen's Gambit for the first time in his
life. The game continued in the Tartakover Variation, a line which
Spassky had never lost, and ended in a brilliant win for White. After
the game Spassky joined the 1500 spectators in applauding his
opponent. 'Did you see that? That was class.', Fischer said later of
Spassky's show of applause.

<P>
With three wins in the last four games, Fischer was now winning the
match.

For the eighth game Fisher accepted the presence of television cameras
on the condition that they be kept at least 150 feet (about 45 meters)
from the chess board. He also demanded that Fox's camera team be
replaced. Not wanting to jeopardize his investment, Fox sold the
rights to the American television company ABC for 100.000 US$.

<P>
On the 15th move, Spassky lost the exchange. Whether it was a
sacrifice or a blunder, he went on to lose the game.

Trailing 5-3, Spassky took a time out for game 9.  When the game was
played on 1 August, it became clear that he was having difficulties
with Fischer's constant psychological pressure, both on and off the
board. After each move, Spassky left the stage and disappeared into
the wings. The game, the shortest draw in the match, ended after 29
moves.

<P>
William Lombardy, Fischer's second, later remarked that he could not
understand how Spassky could endure Fischer's behavior for even a
single game. Realizing that their genial star was being beaten, the
Soviet authorities attempted to recall Spassky back to Moscow. He
resisted on sporting grounds.

<P>
Fischer won the tenth game, crushing Spassky's Breyer Defense
(9...Nb8) in a sharply played Ruy Lopez.

For game 11, Spassky narrowed the gap to 6 1/2 - 4 1/2, winning
against Fischer's Poison Pawn variation in a Najdorf Sicilian. Fischer
failed to find a good plan against Spassky's 14.Nb1 innovation and was
crushed.

Game 14 was agreed drawn in a rook and pawn endgame. Game 15 began the
day after Fox filed a lawsuit for 1.750.000 US$ in a New York court
for damages from Fischer. Fischer's lawyers responded that the
challenger had no contractual obligation with Fox. The legal
maneuvering continued off the board.

<P>
The 15th game was another Sicilian Najdorf, but Fischer avoided the
Poison Pawn variation which had cost him game 11. He lost a pawn early
in the game, developed a strong attack, and missed a win.

Efim Geller, Spassky's chief second, accused Fischer of using
unethical means to disturb Spassky's concentration. During the night
Icelandic police swept the playing hall for electronic devices. They

The 18th game was another hard fought draw, where both players had

knight, but was unable to convert his daring play into a win.

The next day Spassky resigned the match by telephone. Fischer at first
refused to accept the legality of this, preferring the customary
signing of the scoresheet. Finally he acquiesed and, on 1 September,
the match was over. Fischer's victory ended 24 years of Soviet
domination of the World Chess Title.
