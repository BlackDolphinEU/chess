A search at the United States Patent and Trademark Office on 'chess' pulls up close to 3000 patents, with over 300 mentioning chess in the patent title or abstract. Many of these chess patents represent useful extensions of the game that is played throughout the world; the 'Fischer' clock is a good example. Many others are somewhat odd. We've collected a few that we like and that can be understood from a drawing incorporated in the patent.

<P>
<B>Abstract:</B>
'A chess clock is provided which is electronic in operation and digital in display having three modes of operation. In the first mode, the tournament mode, the display has two digital clock displays in minutes and seconds which indicate the time remaining in any given period for each player, together with the total number of required moves remaining. The total time allotted in each period, and the number of moves are programmable into the clock. The subsequent periods to the primary first period are also programmable into the clock with time remaining in preceding periods automatically added on to subsequent periods.'<br />

<P>
<B>Abstract:</B>
'A casing with common padded first and second cavities holds two self-contained, battery-operated, commercial, digital-electronic pocket-calculators in a removable fashion. The "equal/repeat" keys of both calculators are brought out to calculator-embedded contacts by the manufacturer. The casing further includes a rocking rod, two micro switches, a battery and a control circuit. The control circuit develops "shorts" spaced by one second time intervals. The calculators are used as time-pre-programmed, decrementing, by seconds, time, scorekeepers as the shorting pulses are applied to the one calculator whose owner's move it is in a game of speed chess. The calculators and other parts are consumer-replaceable.'<br />

'A pocket-size chess set is disclosed, comprising a pair of identical panels pivotally secured at their inner edges to a narrow third intermediate panel, whereby the first two panels may be folded together to form a case with the third panel acting as a spine. Two slidable para-magnetic checkerboard halves are provided, on the top surface of each of the first two panels. Thirty-two chessmen are also provided. Each of the latter is provided with a magnetic element on its back and bottom surfaces. Thus, each chessman may be placed either horizontally or vertically on the checkerboard halves. The squares of the latter have a recessed portion and their margins are also recessed for the placing of captured chessmen thereon. The case is kept in closed position by the magnetic attraction of the chessmen for one another.'<br />

'The computer robot arm chess game assembly is provided with a chess board, magnetized chess pieces, auxiliary parking locations for the chess pieces, and an articulated radially moving robot arm. The robot arm can perform all the functions of an opponent including setting up the chess board, captures, promotions, castling, etc. The chess board and parking locations include magnetic members to not only activate resilient switches but further to spatially position the chess pieces for accurate location to assist the robot arm. Among the other interesting features, the robot arm can show emotional characteristics which can be accompanied by appropriate sounds and lights contemporaneous with a significant occurrence during the progress of the chess game.'<br />

'The disclosure is of a three-person chess game and board having a central playing area in the form of an equilateral triangle bordered at each of its three sides by a rectangular playing field or area having at least two rows of eight squares each according to at least part of the conventional chess or checker board. Each rectangular field is contiguous with its side of the triangle and moves are made from the rectangle into the triangle and subsequently into either of the other rectangles according to prescribed rules. At least some of the moves are dictated by an element of chance, such as the roll of one die. The rectangles are identical and three conventional chess sets are used, albeit these may be of contrasting colors as may be the markings of the chess board squares as well as the smaller triangles into which the basic central triangle is subdivided.'<br />

<B>Abstract:</B>
'A chess game having a circular chess game board and 32 chess pieces. The game board is subdivided into four equally sized quadrants where each quadrant represents an 8.times.8 chess game board. The quadrants form a pattern of eight concentric rings of spaces. Each group of 16 chess pieces, one group for each player, is initially positioned to occupy the spaces on the two outermost concentric rings. A first group occupies two quadrants and a second group occupies the two other quadrants. The game provides 3 modes of play. Each mode of play requires a different limitation of the movement of chess pieces within the quadrants.'<br />

<P>
<B>Abstract:</B>
'An improved chess set, for play by opposing two-man teams, comprises a game board fifteen squares wide and twelve squares deep. Each team has a playing piece set comprising a common king and a player set for each of the team players. Each player set, color coded for identification, comprises two rooks, two knights, two bishops and a queen disposed on the outside rows of the game board. Each player set further comprises seven pawns, disposed on the squares immediately in front of the seven principal pieces. Each team set of playing pieces further includes a warder, for common play by either team member. The warder is initially disposed on the square in advance of the king and may be moved to any of the squares within a designated "castle area". The warder may be captured only by a knight or pawn. Each team member is limited to moving the pieces of his assigned player set, plus his team's king and warder. Excepting the provisions relating to the warder, the movement of playing pieces and their capture may be the same as in the well recognized rules of the game of chess.'<br />

<B>Abstract:</B>
'A modified chess game for play by two opposing players comprises a game board eight squares wide and sixteen squares deep, foldable at its midsection to create a carrying case for the pieces. Each player has a playing pieces set consisting of two kings, two queens, four rooks, four knights, four bishops and sixteen pawns. The pieces are positioned as in conventional chess, except that each row is doubled. Playing pieces are moved pursuant to conventional movements and rules of capture, except that pawns may advance two spaces at a time as long as they are in their own territory, and must reach the sixteenth row to be exchanged for any playing piece but the king. The game may be played so that a player wins by capturing both of his opponent's kings, or by capturing only one.'<br />
