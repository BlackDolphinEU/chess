<B>Opening Tutorial : English - Symmetrical Variation</B><BR>
The position after 1.c4 c5 is known as the Symmetrical Variation of the English Opening. The lack of direct contact between the armies and the absence of threats means that there are a generous number of moves that can be played in different orders by both sides. Transpositions from one position to another are common and transpositions into openings other than the English are possible at many steps.

Paul Hoffman is a bestselling author of books for the general public, and 'King's Gambit' is one of the best general interest books ever written about chess. A keen chess player as an adolescent, the author followed the same path as many young players, abandoning the game in college and returning to it in middle age. The chess stories, many from personal observation, are well recounted and entertaining. The chess personalities come to life through the author's words, as though he were talking to you over dinner.

<B>Getting Started with Chess : Learn the Openings</B><BR>
Why learn the chess openings? (1) Because it doesn't matter how well you play the middle game and endgame if you lose in the opening. (2) Because the position at the beginning of the game is the only position you are guaranteed to see in every game.

<B>Issues on the Chess Table : Short Draws</B><BR>
'Would you like a draw?' The problem with short draws in chess is not that the games are drawn, but that they are drawn before the result is clear. One of the players proposes a draw and the other accepts. Sometimes the players agree on a draw after only 15-20 moves have been played. These short draws are also called 'grandmaster draws'.

<B>Opening Tutorial : Caro-Kann Defense</B><BR>
The Caro-Kann (1.e4 c6) is the fourth most popular response to 1.e4 after 1...c5, 1...e5, and 1...e6, and is considered one of Black's most solid responses to 1.e4. The player of the Black pieces is saying that a drawn game is an acceptable result. White's problem is to generate winning chances.

<B>CD Review : The Best of Chess Informant - Garry Kasparov</B><BR>
Masters beat most players; grandmasters beat masters; super grandmasters beat grandmasters; and Kasparov beat super grandmasters. What can most players learn from Kasparov? Our answer is that you don't have to be a great artist to appreciate great art; ditto for chess. This Chess Informant CD has almost 600 games annotated by Kasparov. There are also 72 combinations and 68 brilliant moves, all prepared for software which emulates solitaire chess. But that's not all.

<B>The Saga of Chess Unification (1994-2006)</B><BR>
The events in 1993 which created the schism in the World Championship were initially followed by a string of unqualified successes for the fledgling PCA. Was chess entering its golden age? No, potential sponsors were confused when faced with two World Champions and the bickering between rival chess organizations both claiming to be the owner of the *real* championship. Talk of reunification began in 1994.

<B>Opening Tutorial : Queen's Indian Defense</B><BR>
Which opening is the closest in spirit to the Queen's Indian Defense (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 b6)? If you guessed King's Indian because of the name, you guessed wrong. The closest is the Nimzo Indian (3.Nc3 Bb4) where the battle for e2-e4 -- White to play it, Black to prevent it -- also determines the best moves for both sides.

<B>Review: 'Chess for Tigers' by Simon Webb</B><BR>
Should you play the board or play the opponent? It's a trick question, because the answer depends on where you happen to be on the chess learning curve. Inexperienced players should play the board, avoiding blunders and finding good moves. Experienced players should consider other factors: the opponent, the clock, the tournament situation, their own strengths and weaknesses. This book is for those players

<B>Advanced Positional Terminology in Chess</B><BR>
Good chess players have their own jargon to describe certain advanced features of a chess position or of a chess move. Several of the most important terms were invented by Aron Nimzovitch (1886-1935) or are often associated with his name. Other terms in general use have more obscure origins and aren't easily attributed to any one player.

<B>Opening Tutorial : Reti Opening</B><BR>
The move 1.Nf3 is commonly known as the Reti Opening. Richard Rti (1889-1929) began playing it at the highest levels of chess in 1923. His reasoning was that since 1.e4 and 1.d4 present targets in the center, White should hold back these moves until Black's own intentions are clear. This was the foundation of the Hypermodern approach to chess openings.

<B>The Origin of Modern Chess</B><BR>
Near the end of the 15th century, the game of chess underwent a dramatic transformation when the powers of two of the weakest pieces were enhanced. The slow game characterized by a long opening buildup was suddenly a rapid game where checkmate was possible after only a few moves. The new game, quickly adopted wherever it was played, pushed the old game aside after only a few decades.

The opening 1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4 is known as the Queen's Gambit Accepted (QGA).

Everyone knows that after 2...dxc4, Black can't keep the Pawn, but there is a lot more to the QGA than that.
