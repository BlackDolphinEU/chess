<B><I>The Midnight Challenge</I>, or 'Christmas in Russia'</B><BR>

<B>Steinitz on the 'Relative Value of the Pieces'</B><BR>
The 1st World Champion's explanations are as valid today as when they were written over 100 years ago. In this brilliant introduction to positional play, Steinitz discusses the special powers of each of the six pieces; the differences between the Rook, Bishop, and Knight on the Queenside vs. the same pieces on the Kingside; and the relative strengths of each of the eight Pawns.

<B>Kasparov - X3D Fritz, New York, 2003</B><BR>
Explaining positional play in a game between Kasparov and a computer is not an easy task. First, computers are not known for their positional play. Second, Kasparov's play is so subtle and complex that it is often beyond explanation. Let's not let that stop us!

<B>The Year 2002 in Review</B><BR>
If chess were a wine, 2002 might not have been a great year, but it was certainly a very good year. Its highlights were a FIDE World Championship final, an Olympiad, and a brave attempt at reconciling the nine-year split in the World Championship title.

Pawnless endgames may not appear in many games, but they are important when evaluating more complex endgames. Here are the simplest -- Rook vs. minor piece, Rook & minor piece vs. Rook, Queen vs. Rook -- you should know them.
