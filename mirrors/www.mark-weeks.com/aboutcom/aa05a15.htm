(January 2005)

Last July, while on a routine review of Google News reports, a <I>Washington Post</I> story titled 'Ex-Chess Champion Bobby Fischer Detained' caught our eye.

The story, subtitled 'Fugitive Held in Japan on Charges Stemming From '92 Spassky Match in Yugoslavia', continued, 'The hunt for Bobby Fischer, the unpredictable chess legend, ended this week when he was detained in Japan, where he awaits possible deportation on charges that he attended a 1992 match in Yugoslavia in violation of a U.S. ban.'

<P>
Within a few hours, the same story was popping up in news sources all over the world.

It would become not only the biggest chess story of 2004, but also the longest running. 

Six months later, Fischer was still languishing in Japanese custody.

<P>
<I>About Chess</I> has been following the Fischer saga in a series of blog entries called 'Finding Bobby Fischer' (for an index of the entries, see the link box in the upper right corner of this article).

While every twist and turn in Fischer's continuing ordeal is reported in the mainstream press, the games that got him into his current predicament are forgotten.

We decided to do something about that.

<P>
We gathered all 30 games from Fischer's 1992 match with Boris Spassky and loaded them into the <I>About Chess</I> game viewer (see the link box again).

We also loaded the 20 games from the 1972 Fischer - Spassky World Championship match into the same viewer. 

These games are as fascinating today as they were when they were first played over 30 years ago.

<P>
A few weeks after Fischer's detention, Spassky wrote a letter to U.S. President George W. Bush pleading, 'Put sanctions against me also. Arrest me. And put me in the same cell with Bobby Fischer. And give us a chess set.'

Fischer's reaction was typically irreverent. 'I didn’t like the tone -- he was trying to make me sound like a weirdie. I don’t want Spassky in my cell. I want a chick.'

<P>
Enjoy the games. Fischer has said many times that he will never play chess again.
