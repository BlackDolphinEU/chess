&#149;
'At a time when chess players should be slipping, Garry Kasparov is still at the top of the chess world, where he has now been perched for over 18 years. Today is his 40th birthday, and instead of putting together a summary of his career we simply clicked a few times in ChessBase and allowed the database which he originally initiated to put together some biographical information.'

'It looks like the FIDE world championship will be held in early September in Yalta, Ukraine.

&#149;
'We know him as an fear-inspiring player on the chess board, but in the political arena Garry Kasparov also remains true to his nature.

You can see this in his article in the Wall Street Journal and his powerful statement to the Human Rights commission in Washington.'
