<B>Opening Tutorial : Nimzo Indian Defense - 4.e3</B><BR>
One of the best moves to meet the Nimzo Indian Defense (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4) is 4.e3. Many authorities call this the 'Rubinstein Variation'. Unlike other moves, 4.e3 doesn't attempt to refute Black's setup. White builds a strong center and aims for flexible development. One idea is to continue Ng1-e2, recapturing with the Knight if Black plays ...Bxc3+.

<B>Opening Tutorial : French Defense - 3.Nc3</B><BR>
The most common continuation of the French Defense is 2.d4 d5. Black accepts a restricted Bishop and less space in return for a solid position which is not easily breached. The variations after 3.Nc3, where the Knight develops to its natural square, keep the central tension. Black has three good replies: 3...Bb4, 3...Nf6, and 3...dxe4.

<B>Opening Tutorial : Queen's Gambit Declined - 4.Bg5</B><BR>
A popular response by Black to 1.d4 is the Queen's Gambit Declined (often abbreviated QGD) : 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6. The game usually continues 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5, which pins the Black Knight and threatens 5.cxd5 exd5 6.Bxf6 gxf6, ruining Black's Kingside. As with most Queen Pawn openings, the QGD move orders are flexible. In this tutorial we look at the main ideas.

The variation 1.c4 e5 of the English Opening is called the Reversed Sicilian. Because the Reversed Sicilian is a tempo ahead of the Sicilian, many beginning players assume there must be something wrong with it for Black. Experienced players know that even if not logical, it is eminently playable.

After the board is separated into two pieces by ...e5 and d5, White attacks on the Queenside and Black attacks on the Kingside. Piece exchanges are infrequent and combinations arise everywhere.

<B>Romance in Chess</B><BR>
'What could possibly be less romantic than chess?' you might be asking. After all, chess is a game of war based on logic, isn't it? Chess once served a social function of allowing young men and women to meet over the board. The scientific view of chess as a game of logic took hold only at the end of the 19th-century. The greatest proponent of the earlier romantic style was Adolph Anderssen.
