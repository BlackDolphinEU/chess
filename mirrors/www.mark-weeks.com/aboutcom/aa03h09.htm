What exactly is a 'chess trap'? First lets look at the various meanings of the word 'trap', as defined by <I>The Merriam-Webster Dictionary</I>.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>trap</B> <I>n.</I> 
<OL>
<LI> : a device for catching animals
<LI> : something by which one is caught unawares
<LI> : a machine for throwing objects into the air to be targets for shooters; <I>also</I> : a hazard on a golf course consisting of a depression containing sand
<LI> : a light 2-wheeled or 4-wheeled one-horse carriage on springs
<LI> : a device to allow some one thing to pass through while keeping other things out &lt;a ~ in a drainpipe&gt;
<LI> <I>pl</I> : a group of percussion instruments used in a jazz or dance orchestra
<OL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<I>The Oxford Companion to Chess</I> says
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>trap</B>, generally an attractive line of play that is less advantageous than it appears and which may have been deliberately set as a temptation by the opponent. As much could be said of many possibilities in a game, and there is no precise definition of a trap, nor is the element of temptation essential.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
When one of the great contemporary authorities on chess says, 'there is no precise definition of a trap', we have no choice but to return to <I>Merriam-Webster</I>.

Since 'a device for catching animals' isn't at all flattering, we move to 'something by which one is caught unawares'. Yes, that's it. A chess trap has a large element of surprise; the trapped player didn't notice anything special, but the position is suddenly, completely, irrevocably lost.

<P>
Getting caught in a chess trap on a chess board is about as much fun as getting caught in a sand trap on a golf course, so we also like that third dictionary definition.

As for the other definitions, they have no relation to a chess trap and stand as testimony to the flexibility of the English language.

<P>
Chess traps are a special branch of opening theory, even though they can be set at any time in the game. When they occur in the middle or end game, we usually call them <I>swindles</I>.

A trap is almost always the result of a bad move, or <I>blunder</I>, and when a game ends abruptly in the opening, it's known as a <I>miniature</I>.

Enough definitions : let's have some traps!

<P>
<CENTER>***</CENTER>

<P>
We collected 12 chess books dedicated to the art of the trap, compared the traps across the books, and found many that appeared in more than two books. 

Those best-loved traps are the basis for the <I>About Chess</I> traps series, which we're developing for our next series of opening articles. 

<P>
Each quiz has seven traps with solutions.

A few of the solutions are particularly complicated, with many variations, so you may need to follow them on a chess board.

They are not organized in any particular order, although the first quiz contains the most popular traps in our 12 sources.

Good trapping!
